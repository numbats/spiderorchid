\title{Fetch publications from ORCID}
\usage{
fetch_orcid(orcid_ids)
}
\arguments{
\item{orcid_ids}{A character vector of ORCID IDs.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing all publications for the specified ORCID IDs.
}
\description{
Retrieves publications for given ORCID IDs, and returns them as a tibble.
}
\details{
This function requires authentication on ORCID. If you have not previously
authenticated, it will prompt you to do so when first run. If you just
follow the prompts, you will be authenticated, but only for downloading your
own papers. If you want to download papers from other ORCID IDs, you will
need to authenticate with a 2-legged OAuth. Follow the instructions at
<https://info.orcid.org/register-a-client-application-production-member-api/>.
To avoid having to do this in each session, store the token obtained from
`orcid_auth()` in your `.Renviron` file by running `usethis::edit_r_environ()`.
It should be of the form \code{ORCID_TOKEN=<your token>}.
