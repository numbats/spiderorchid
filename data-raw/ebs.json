The method involves maximizing a propensity score weighted multinomial quasi-log-likelihood function with a multinomial logit conditional mean. We show that this estimator, which we call weighted multivariate fractional logit (wmflogit), consistently estimates the potential outcome means if either the propensity score model or the conditional mean model is misspecified. Our simulations demonstrate this double robustness property for the case of shares generated using a Dirichlet distribution. Finally, we advocate for the use of wmflogit by applying it to estimate time-use shares of women participating in the Mexican conditional cash transfer program, Progresa, using Stata\u2019s fmlogit command developed by Buis.</p>", "output_year": 2024, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Doubly robust estimation of multivariate fractional outcome means with multivalued treatments", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Negi, A & Wooldridge, JM 2024, 'Doubly robust estimation of multivariate fractional outcome means with multivalued treatments', Econometric Reviews, vol. 43, no. 2-4. https://doi.org/10.1080/07474938.2024.2310987", "output_keywords": "fractional outcomes | unconfoundedness | Double robustness | multinomial", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Economics and Econometrics", "output_id": 580119537, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85187112986", "journal_title": "Econometric Reviews", "journal_issn_list": "0747-4938", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 1, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 2, "internal_author_list": "Negi, Akanksha", "external_author_list": "Wooldridge, Jeffrey M.", "external_author_org_list": "Michigan State University", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": 36.94486618041992, "y": 16.08338737487793}, {"output_uuid": "0a4dc852-bb86-486c-b035-8ce2a0cdc12a", "Abstract": "<p>This article proposes a class of M-estimators that double weight for the joint problems of nonrandom treatment assignment and missing outcomes.

The two parts help to summarize the misspecification scenarios permissible under the given framework and the role played by double weighting in each.

We observe exceptionally strong population structure across Australia, driven by divergence times between communities of 26,000\u201335,000 years ago and long-term low but stable effective population sizes. This demographic history, including early divergence from Papua New Guinean (47,000 years ago) and Eurasian groups, has generated the highest proportion of previously undescribed genetic variation seen outside Africa and the most extended homozygosity compared with global samples. A substantial proportion of this variation is not observed in global reference panels or clinical datasets, and variation with predicted functional consequence is more likely to be homozygous than in other populations, with consequent implications for medical genomics. Our results show that Indigenous Australians are not a single homogeneous genetic group and their genetic relationship with the peoples of New Guinea is not uniform.

Specifically, the WPI technique for determining the stochastic response of diverse nonlinear dynamical systems treats the system response joint transition probability density function as a functional integral over the space of all possible paths connecting the initial and the final states of the response vector. This functional integral is evaluated, ordinarily, by resorting to an approximate approach that considers the contribution only of the most probable path. The most probable path corresponds to an extremum of the functional integrand and is determined by solving a functional minimization problem that takes the form of a deterministic boundary value problem (BVP). In this paper, first, it is shown that for the commonly considered case of the system nonlinearity being of polynomial form, there exist globally optimal solutions corresponding to the most probable path BVP. Further, relying on algebraic geometry concepts and tools, a condition is derived for determining if the BVP for the most probable path exhibits a unique solution over a specific region. Furthermore, a novel solution approach is developed for the BVP by relying on Sylvester's dialytic method of elimination. Notably, the method reduces the complexity of the BVP system of coupled multivariate polynomial equations by eliminating one or more variables.

EnKF methods have also been developed for parameter inference of static Bayesian models with a Gaussian likelihood, in a way that is analogous to likelihood tempering sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). These methods are commonly referred to as ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI). Unlike SMC, the inference from EKI is asymptotically biased if the likelihood is non-linear and/or non-Gaussian and if the priors are non-Gaussian. However, it is significantly faster to run. Currently, a large limitation of EKI methods is that the covariance of the measurement error is assumed to be fully known. We develop a new method, which we call component-wise iterative EKI (CW-IEKI), that allows elements of the covariance matrix to be inferred alongside the model parameters at negligible extra cost. This novel method is compared to SMC on a linear Gaussian example as well as four examples with non-linear dynamics (i.e. non-linear function of the model parameters). The non-linear examples include a set of population models applied to synthetic data, a model of nitrogen mineralisation in soil that is based on the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator, a model predicting seagrass decline due to stress from water temperature and light, and a model predicting coral calcification rates.

In this paper, we extend the current state-of-the-art cross-sectional probabilistic forecast reconciliation approach to encompass a cross-temporal framework, where temporal constraints are also applied. Our proposed methodology employs both parametric Gaussian and non-parametric bootstrap approaches to draw samples from an incoherent cross-temporal distribution. To improve the estimation of the forecast error covariance matrix, we propose using multi-step residuals, especially in the time dimension where the usual one-step residuals fail. To address high-dimensionality issues, we present four alternatives for the covariance matrix, where we exploit the two-fold nature (cross-sectional and temporal) of the cross-temporal structure, and introduce the idea of overlapping residuals. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed cross-temporal reconciliation approaches through a simulation study that investigates their theoretical and empirical properties and two forecasting experiments, using the Australian GDP and the Australian Tourism Demand datasets. For both applications, the optimal cross-temporal reconciliation approaches significantly outperform the incoherent base forecasts in terms of the continuous ranked probability score and the energy score. Overall, the results highlight the potential of the proposed methods to improve the accuracy of probabilistic forecasts and to address the challenge of integrating disparate scenarios while coherently taking into account short-term operational, medium-term tactical, and long-term strategic planning.</p>", "output_year": 2023, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Cross-temporal probabilistic forecast reconciliation", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Girolimetto, D, Athanasopoulos, G, Di Fonzo, T & Hyndman, RJ 2023, 'Cross-temporal probabilistic forecast reconciliation: methodological and practical issues', International Journal of Forecasting. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijforecast.2023.10.003", "output_keywords": "Forecast reconciliation | Probabilistic forecasting | Cross-temporal | Linearly constrained multiple time series | Tourism flows | GDP", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Business and International Management", "output_id": 554950506, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85176461681", "journal_title": "International Journal of Forecasting", "journal_issn_list": "0169-2070", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 2, "output_author_count_internal": 2, "output_author_count_total": 4, "internal_author_list": "Athanasopoulos, George | Hyndman, Robin John", "external_author_list": "Di Fonzo, Tommaso | Girolimetto, Daniele", "external_author_org_list": "Universita degli Studi di Padova (University of Padua)", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": 9, "x": -45.79426193237305, "y": -3.6210851669311523}, {"output_uuid": "6181a0c6-0f88-4960-b0ec-75e4b9cd5565", "Abstract": "<p>We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the past, present, and future development of environmental related topics in Economics and Finance.

However, the informational content of low-frequency variables and the results from conditional mean models provide only limited evidence to investigate this problem. We propose a novel mixed-frequency quantile vector autoregression (MF-QVAR) model to address this issue. Inspired by the univariate Bayesian quantile regression literature, the multivariate asymmetric Laplace distribution is exploited under the Bayesian framework to form the likelihood. A data augmentation approach coupled with a precision sampler efficiently estimates the missing low-frequency variables at higher frequencies under the state-space representation. The proposed methods allow us to analyse conditional quantiles for multiple variables of interest and to derive quantile-related risk measures at high frequency, thus enabling timely policy interventions.

Much has been written about this topic, and in most cases we do not believe that a conventional Bayesian analysis is meaningful when there is serious model misspecification. Nevertheless, in some cases it is possible to use a well-specified model to give meaning to a Bayesian analysis of a misspecified model, and we focus on such cases. Three main classes of methods are discussed: restricted likelihood methods, which use a model based on an insufficient summary of the original data; modular inference methods, which use a model constructed from coupled submodels, with some of the submodels correctly specified; and the use of a reference model to construct a projected posterior or predictive distribution for a simplified model considered to be useful for prediction or interpretation.", "output_year": 2023, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Review Article", "output_title": "Bayesian inference for misspecified generative models", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Nott, DJ, Drovandi, CC & Frazier, DT 2023, 'Bayesian inference for misspecified generative models', Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application. https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-statistics-040522-015915", "output_keywords": null, "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": null, "output_id": 520660650, "publication_import_source": null, "publication_import_id": null, "journal_title": "Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application", "journal_issn_list": "2326-8298", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 2, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 3, "internal_author_list": "Frazier, David Tyler", "external_author_list": "Drovandi, Christopher C. | Nott, David John", "external_author_org_list": "National University of Singapore | Queensland University of Technology (QUT)", "external_author_country_list": "Australia", "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": 32.49100875854492, "y": 9.751045227050781}, {"output_uuid": "3835d729-0536-46e1-ac66-5e7196ebd51d", "Abstract": "Risk premia are difficult to identify in nonstorable commodities such as electricity.

KIR3DL1 is an inhibitory receptor, and KIR3DS1 is an activating receptor encoded by the KIR3DL1/S1 gene that has more than 200 diverse and divergent alleles. Determination of KIR3DL1/S1 genotypes for medical application is hampered by complex sequence and structural variation, requiring targeted approaches to generate and analyze high-resolution allele data. To overcome these obstacles, we developed and optimized a model for imputing KIR3DL1/S1 alleles at high-resolution from whole-genome SNP data. We designed the model to represent a substantial component of human genetic diversity. Our Global imputation model is effective at genotyping KIR3DL1/S1 alleles with an accuracy ranging from 88% in Africans to 97% in East Asians, with mean specificity of 99% and sensitivity of 95% for alleles >1% frequency. We used the established algorithm of the HIBAG program, in a modification named Pulling Out Natural killer cell Genomics (PONG). Because HIBAG was designed to impute HLA alleles also from whole-genome SNP data, PONG allows combinatorial diversity of KIR3DL1/S1 with HLA-A and -B to be analyzed using complementary techniques on a single data source.

In recent years, interest has grown in modelling multiple species simultaneously, partly due to the ability to \u2018borrow strength\u2019 from similar species to improve predictions. Mixed and hierarchical models allow this but typically assume a (generalised) linear relationship between covariates and species presence and absence. On the other hand, popular machine learning techniques such as random forests and boosted regression trees are able to model complex nonlinear relationships but consider only one species at a time. We apply multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) to the problem of species distribution modelling. MOGPs model each species' response to the environment as a weighted sum of a small number of nonlinear functions, each modelled by a Gaussian process. While Gaussian process models are notoriously computationally intensive, recent techniques from the machine learning literature as well as using graphics processing units (GPUs) allow us to scale the model to datasets with hundreds of species at thousands of sites. We evaluate the MOGP against four baseline models on six different datasets. Overall, the MOGP is competitive with the best single-species and joint-species models, while being much faster to fit. On single-species metrics (AUC and log likelihood), the MOGP and single-output GPs outperformed tree-based models (random forest and boosted regression trees) and a joint species distribution model (JSDM). Compared to single-output GPs, the MOGP generally has a higher AUC for rare species with fewer than 50 observation in the dataset. When evaluated using joint-species log likelihood, the MOGP outperforms all models apart from the JSDM, which has a better joint likelihood on three datasets and similar performance on the three others. A key advantage of the MOGP is speed: on the largest dataset, it is around 18 times faster than fitting single output GPs, and over 80 times faster to fit than the JSDM. Our results suggest that both MOGPs and SOGPs are accurate predictive models of species distributions and that the MOGP is particularly compelling when predictions for rare species are of interest.</p>", "output_year": 2020, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Multi-output Gaussian processes for species distribution modelling", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Ingram, M, Vukcevic, D & Golding, N 2020, 'Multi-output Gaussian processes for species distribution modelling', Methods in Ecology and Evolution, vol. 11, no. 12, pp. 1587-1598. https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13496", "output_keywords": "species distribution models | Gaussian process | multi-species modelling", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics | Ecological Modelling", "output_id": 518059711, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85092457029", "journal_title": "Methods in Ecology and Evolution", "journal_issn_list": "2041-210X", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 2, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 3, "internal_author_list": "Vukcevic, Damjan", "external_author_list": "Golding, Nick | Ingram, Martin", "external_author_org_list": "University of Melbourne", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": 35.772003173828125, "y": 11.270761489868164}, {"output_uuid": "1ab10d5d-07a1-43f7-af9d-8dab5d65a9fe", "Abstract": "<p>The killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), found predominantly on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells and some T-cells, are a collection of highly polymorphic activating and inhibitory receptors with variable specificity for class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligands.

Results show that one of the statistical methods (autoregressive integrated moving average, or, for short, ARIMA) outperforms machine and deep learning methods. The second phase compares different combinations of aggregation criteria, structures of the forecasting system, and coherent forecast methods (i.e., adjustments to the forecasts at different levels of aggregation). The results show that using different criteria and structures indeed impacts predictions' accuracy. When it is necessary to disaggregate the forecast, our results show that it is best to add more information in a grouped structure, adjusted by a bottom-up method. This combination provides the best performance, that is, the lowest mean absolute-scaled error (MASE) in most nodes, compared to the other structures and coherent forecast methods used.

We present an optimal investment and retirement benefits schedule for TBP members with a fixed contribution rate. Using Australian data from 1965 to 2018, we evaluate the performance of the optimal TBP scheme and compare it to the optimal DC scheme. By adopting the benefit-investment strategy derived in this paper, we demonstrate the stability of benefit distribution over time for a TBP scheme in this stochastic formulation. To outperform the DC scheme's benefit payment, careful consideration shall be given to the benefit target in the TBP scheme. A high target may not be achievable, while a low target can impede the accumulation momentum of the fund's wealth in its early stages. Moreover, a TBP fund's investment strategy is primarily influenced by the wealth target, with more aggressive investments in risky assets as the wealth target increases. This analysis may shed light on the possible improvements to retirement planning in Australia.

Here, we report on the dynamic modelling study that directly informed policies within the national re-opening plan including the identification of priority age groups for vaccination, target vaccine coverage thresholds and the anticipated requirements for continued public health measures-assuming circulation of the Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant. Our findings demonstrated that adult vaccine coverage needed to be at least 60% to minimize public health and clinical impacts following the establishment of community transmission. They also supported the need for continued application of test-trace-isolate-quarantine and social measures during the vaccine roll-out phase and beyond.</p>", "output_year": 2023, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "COVID-19 vaccine coverage targets to inform reopening plans in a low incidence setting", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Conway, E, Walker, CR, Baker, C, Lydeamore, MJ, Ryan, GE, Campbell, T, Miller, JC, Rebuli, N, Yeung, M & Kabashima, G et al. 2023, 'COVID-19 vaccine coverage targets to inform reopening plans in a low incidence setting', Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, vol. 290, no. 2005, pp. 20231437. https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2023.1437", "output_keywords": "pandemic response | SARS-CoV-2 | vaccination strategy | public health policy | COVID-19 | mathematical modelling", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Agricultural and Biological Sciences(all) | Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology(all) | Environmental Science(all) | Immunology and Microbiology(all)", "output_id": 507007498, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85168985781", "journal_title": "Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences", "journal_issn_list": "0962-8452", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 16, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 17, "internal_author_list": "Lydeamore, Michael John", "external_author_list": "Baker, Christopher | Campbell, Trish | Conway, Eamon | Geard, Nicholas | Golding, Nick | Kabashima, Greg | McCaw, James M. | McVernon, Jodie | Miller, Joel C. | Price, David J. | Rebuli, Nicolas | Ryan, Gerard E. | Shearer, Freya M. | Walker, Camelia R. | Wood, James G. | Yeung, Max", "external_author_org_list": "Curtin University | La Trobe University | Monash University | Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity | Quantium Pty Ltd | Telethon Kids Institute | University of Melbourne | University of New South Wales (UNSW) | Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (WEHI)", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": 31.77438735961914, "y": 16.827665328979492}, {"output_uuid": "56a1df2b-bb94-448e-9753-fb92ff79e161", "Abstract": "<p>We examine the impact of return predictability and parameter uncertainty on long-term portfolio allocations when investors\u2019 utility function quantifies their asymmetric behaviour against expected gains and losses on risky assets.

However, a substantial proportion of MBW tests in infants fail current acceptability criteria. We hypothesised that a model-based approach to analysing the data, in place of traditional simple empirical summaries, would enable more efficient use of these tests. We therefore developed a novel statistical model for infant MBW data and applied it to 1197 tests from 432 individuals from a large birth cohort study. We focus on Bayesian estimation of the lung clearance index, the most commonly used summary of lung function from MBW tests. Our results show that the model provides an excellent fit to the data and shed further light on statistical properties of the standard empirical approach. Furthermore, the modelling approach enables the lung clearance index to be estimated by using tests with different degrees of completeness, something not possible with the standard approach. Our model therefore allows previously unused data to be used rather than discarded, as well as routine use of shorter tests without significant loss of precision.

However, common likelihood-free methods do not scale well to a large number of model parameters. A promising approach to high-dimensional likelihood-free inference involves estimating low-dimensional marginal posteriors by conditioning only on summary statistics believed to be informative for the low-dimensional component, and then combining the low-dimensional approximations in some way. In this article, we demonstrate that such low-dimensional approximations can be surprisingly poor in practice for seemingly intuitive summary statistic choices. We describe an idealized low-dimensional summary statistic that is, in principle, suitable for marginal estimation. However, a direct approximation of the idealized choice is difficult in practice. We thus suggest an alternative approach to marginal estimation which is easier to implement and automate. Given an initial choice of low-dimensional summary statistic that might only be informative about a marginal posterior location, the new method improves performance by first crudely localizing the posterior approximation using all the summary statistics to ensure global identifiability, followed by a second step that hones in on an accurate low-dimensional approximation using the low-dimensional summary statistic.

High-frequency measurements produce big datasets that present opportunities to conduct new analyses for improved understanding of water-quality dynamics and more effective management of rivers and streams. Of primary importance is enhancing knowledge of the relationships between nitrate, one of the most reactive forms of inorganic nitrogen in the aquatic environment, and other water-quality variables. We analysed high-frequency water-quality data from in-situ sensors deployed in three sites from different watersheds and climate zones within the National Ecological Observatory Network, USA. We used generalised additive mixed models to explain the nonlinear relationships at each site between nitrate concentration and conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, and elevation. Temporal auto-correlation was modelled with an auto-regressive- moving-average (ARIMA) model and we examined the relative importance of the explanatory variables. Total deviance explained by the models was high for all sites (99%). Although variable importance and the smooth regression parameters differed among sites, the models explaining the most variation in nitrate contained the same explanatory variables. This study demonstrates that building a model for nitrate using the same set of explanatory water-quality variables is achievable, even for sites with vastly different environmental and climatic characteristics. Applying such models will assist managers to select cost-effective water-quality variables to monitor when the goals are to gain a spatial and temporal in-depth understanding of nitrate dynamics and adapt management plans accordingly.</p>", "output_year": 2023, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Understanding links between water-quality variables and nitrate concentration in freshwater streams using high frequency sensor data", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Kermorvant, C, Liquet, B, Litt, G, Mengersen, K, Peterson, EE, Hyndman, RJ, Jones, JB & Leigh, C 2023, 'Understanding links between water-quality variables and nitrate concentration in freshwater streams using high frequency sensor data', PLoS ONE, vol. 18, no. 6, e0287640. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287640", "output_keywords": null, "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "General", "output_id": 486228659, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85164007621", "journal_title": "PLoS ONE", "journal_issn_list": "1932-6203", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 7, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 8, "internal_author_list": "Hyndman, Robin John", "external_author_list": "Jones, Jeremy B. | Kermorvant, Claire | Leigh, Catherine | Liquet, Benoit | Litt, Guy | Mengersen, Kerrie Lee | Peterson, Erin E.", "external_author_org_list": "L'Universit\u00e9 de Pau et des Pays de l'Adou (University of Pau and Pays de l'Adour) | Macquarie University | National Ecological Observatory Network | Peterson, Erin Elizabeth (trading as Erin Peterson Consulting) | Queensland University of Technology (QUT) | RMIT University | University of Alaska Fairbanks", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": -14.215763092041016, "y": -11.404683113098145}, {"output_uuid": "be0a6c3f-3c35-4d2e-92d1-098c1bbfebdb", "Abstract": "<p>Experts commonly believe that Australia needs to intensify efforts to meet its 2030 emission target (OECD, 2019).

In this paper, inverse DEA is applied to determine output (investment income and benefit payments) targets for a given fund to perform at a desired efficiency level when increase in disbursements and risk at known levels is envisaged. An output-oriented inverse DEA model assuming variable returns to scale is formulated with theoretical underpinning. The proposed modelling framework ensures that, when an input augmented fund with estimated output targets is included in the observed fund set, the frontier of best performance established with the observed fund set does not change. The inverse DEA model is applied to a sample of Australian superannuation funds to demonstrate how a given fund may obtain pathways to improve its performance under different input-augmentation scenarios.

Feasible estimators of fixed-bandwidth standard errors are easy to implement and are akin to treating RD estimators as locally parametric, validating the common empirical practice of using heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors in RD settings.

Methods from experimental design can be used to furnish our ability to monitor such ecosystems efficiently. Recently, adaptive design approaches have been proposed for monitoring coral reefs; however, questions have surfaced around the ability of such approaches to capture trends over time. The aim of this study was to develop an approach to assess trends in hard coral cover and evaluate the effectiveness of adaptive designs for estimating such trends in coral reef communities within a region of the Great Barrier Reef. Our approach was couched within a Bayesian design and inference framework such that uncertainty was captured rigorously and so that information from accumulating data can be incorporated straightforwardly to inform future data collection. The designs found under this approach were compared to historical non-adaptive designs which surveyed all locations over time. Through this comparison, we show that adaptive designs can maintain trends over time with little to no loss in information, even when sampling effort is substantially reduced.

Differential equations are often used to model an epidemic outbreak's behaviour but are challenging to parameterise. Furthermore, these models can suffer from misspecification, which biases predictions and parameter estimates. Stochastic models can help with misspecification but are even more expensive to simulate and perform inference with. Here, we develop an explicitly likelihood-based variation of the generalised profiling method as a tool for prediction and inference under model misspecification. Our approach allows us to carry out identifiability analysis and uncertainty quantification using profile likelihood-based methods without the need for marginalisation. We provide justification for this approach by introducing a new interpretation of the model approximation component as a stochastic constraint. This preserves the rationale for using profiling rather than integration to remove nuisance parameters while also providing a link back to stochastic models. We applied an initial version of this method during an outbreak of measles in Samoa in 2019\u20132020 and found that it achieved relatively fast, accurate predictions.

To answer the question for southeastern Australia, where fires were particularly severe, affecting people and ecosystems, we use a physically based index of fire weather, the Fire Weather Index; long-Term observations of heat and drought; and 11 large ensembles of state-of-The-Art climate models. We find large trends in the Fire Weather Index in the fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Atmospheric Reanalysis (ERA5) since 1979 and a smaller but significant increase by at least 30 % in the models. Therefore, we find that climate change has induced a higher weather-induced risk of such an extreme fire season. This trend is mainly driven by the increase of temperature extremes. In agreement with previous analyses we find that heat extremes have become more likely by at least a factor of 2 due to the long-Term warming trend. However, current climate models overestimate variability and tend to underestimate the long-Term trend in these extremes, so the true change in the likelihood of extreme heat could be larger, suggesting that the attribution of the increased fire weather risk is a conservative estimate. We do not find an attributable trend in either extreme annual drought or the driest month of the fire season, September-February. The observations, however, show a weak drying trend in the annual mean. For the 2019/20 season more than half of the July-December drought was driven by record excursions of the Indian Ocean Dipole and Southern Annular Mode, factors which are included in the analysis here. The study reveals the complexity of the 2019/20 bushfire event, with some but not all drivers showing an imprint of anthropogenic climate change. Finally, the study concludes with a qualitative review of various vulnerability and<span idCombining double low line\"page942\"/> exposure factors that each play a role, along with the hazard in increasing or decreasing the overall impact of the bushfires.</p>", "output_year": 2021, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Attribution of the Australian bushfire risk to anthropogenic climate change", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Jan Van Oldenborgh, G, Krikken, F, Lewis, S, Leach, NJ, Lehner, F, Saunders, KR, Van Weele, M, Haustein, K, Li, S & Wallom, D et al. 2021, 'Attribution of the Australian bushfire risk to anthropogenic climate change', Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, vol. 21, no. 3, pp. 941-960. https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-941-2021", "output_keywords": null, "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Earth and Planetary Sciences(all)", "output_id": 437871664, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85102429198", "journal_title": "Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences", "journal_issn_list": "1561-8633", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 16, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 17, "internal_author_list": "Saunders, Kate Robinson", "external_author_list": "Arrighi, Julie | Haustein, Karsten | Jan Van Oldenborgh, Geert | Krikken, Folmer | Leach, Nicholas J. | Lehner, Flavio | Lewis, Sophie C. | Li, Sihan | Otto, Friederike E.L. | Philip, Sjoukje Y. | Singh, Roop K. | Sparrow, Sarah | Van Weele, Michiel | Vautard, Robert | Wallom, David C.

Currently, no consistent definitions of 'warm' or 'cool' seasons for southern Australia exist, making comparisons across studies difficult. Similarly, numerous climate studies in Australia use either arbitrarily defined areas or the Natural Resource Management (NRM) clusters to perform spatial averaging. While the NRM regions were informed by temperature and rainfall information, they remain somewhat arbitrary. Here we use weather type influence on rainfall and clustering methods to quantitatively define climatic regions and seasons over southern Australia. Three methods are explored: k-means clustering and two agglomerative clustering methods, Ward linkage and average linkage. K-means was found to be preferred in temporal clustering, while the average linkage method was preferred for spatial clustering. For southern Australia as a whole, we define the cool season as April-September and warm season as October-March, though we note that a three-season split may provide more nuanced climate analysis. We also show that different regions across southern Australia experience different seasons and demonstrate the changing spatial influence of weather types with the seasons, which may aid regionally or seasonally specific climate analysis. Division of southern Australia into 15 climatic regions shows localised agreement with the NRM clusters where distinct differences in rainfall amounts exist. However, the climate regions defined here better represent the importance of topographical aspect on weather type influence and the inland extent of particular weather types. We suggest that the use of these regions would provide consistent climate analysis across studies if widely adopted. A key requirement for climate scientists is the simplification of data sets into both seasonally or regionally averaged subsets. This simplification, by grouping like regions or seasons, is done for a number of reasons both scientific and practical, including to help understand patterns of variability, underlying drivers and trends in climate and weather, to communicate large amounts of data concisely, to reduce the amount of data required for processing (which becomes increasingly important with higher resolution climate model output), or to more simply draw a physical boundary between regions for other purposes, such as flora and fauna habitat analysis, appropriate agricultural practices or water management.</p>", "output_year": 2021, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Redefining southern Australia's climatic regions and seasons", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Fiddes, S, Pepler, A, Saunders, K & Hope, P 2021, 'Redefining southern Australia's climatic regions and seasons', Journal of Southern Hemisphere Earth Systems Science, vol. 71, no. 1, pp. 92-109. https://doi.org/10.1071/ES20003", "output_keywords": "climate regions | regions | topography | weather type | k-means clustering | Southern Australia | rainfall | seasons | Natural Resource Management (NRM)", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Atmospheric Science | Oceanography | Global and Planetary Change", "output_id": 437871511, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85103584279", "journal_title": "Journal of Southern Hemisphere Earth Systems Science", "journal_issn_list": "2206-5865", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 3, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 4, "internal_author_list": "Saunders, Kate Robinson", "external_author_list": "Fiddes, Sonya | Hope, Pandora | Pepler, Acacia", "external_author_org_list": "Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) (Australia) | Technische Universiteit Delft (Delft University of Technology) | University of Tasmania", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": -37.895179748535156, "y": 6.62710428237915}, {"output_uuid": "31681d25-99a3-42a0-8370-9e4ac1d3bb52", "Abstract": "<p>Compound weather and climate events are combinations of climate drivers and/or hazards that contribute to societal or environmental risk. Studying compound events often requires a multidisciplinary approach combining domain knowledge of the underlying processes with, for example, statistical methods and climate model outputs. Recently, to aid the development of research on compound events, four compound event types were introduced, namely (a) preconditioned, (b) multivariate, (c) temporally compounding, and (d) spatially compounding events. However, guidelines on how to study these types of events are still lacking. Here, we consider four case studies, each associated with a specific event type and a research question, to illustrate how the key elements of compound events (e.g., analytical tools and relevant physical effects) can be identified. These case studies show that (a) impacts on crops from hot and dry summers can be exacerbated by preconditioning effects of dry and bright springs. (b) Assessing compound coastal flooding in Perth (Australia) requires considering the dynamics of a non-stationary multivariate process. For instance, future mean sea-level rise will lead to the emergence of concurrent coastal and fluvial extremes, enhancing compound flooding risk. (c) In Portugal, deep-landslides are often caused by temporal clusters of moderate precipitation events. Finally, (d) crop yield failures in France and Germany are strongly correlated, threatening European food security through spatially compounding effects. These analyses allow for identifying general recommendations for studying compound events.

These wind speed observations have systematic biases, likely caused by improper instrumentation and station sitings. Such systematic biases introduce spatial inconsistencies that prevent comparison of these stations spatially and limit the possible usage of the data. In this paper, we address these issues by improving and developing new methods for identifying suspect observations and adjusting systematic biases. Our complete quality control and bias adjustment procedure consists of four steps: (a) performing within-station quality control tests to check the plausible range and the temporal consistency of observations, (b) adjusting the systematic bias using empirical quantile mapping, (c) implementing between-station quality control to compare observations from neighbouring stations to identify spatially inconsistent observations, and (d) providing estimates of the true wind when CWSs falsely report zero wind speeds, as a complement to the bias adjustment. We apply these methods to CWSs from the Weather Observation Website (WOW) in the Netherlands, comparing the crowdsourced data with official data, and statistically assessing the improvements in data quality after each step. The results demonstrate that the crowdsourced wind speed data are more comparable with official data after quality control checks and bias adjustment steps.

Using data for all firms with ESG scores in G20 countries from 2007 to 2020, we analyze the relationship between the three pillars of ESG scores and firm performance by focusing on the role of these two channels.

One popular modified Bayesian inference method is \u201ccutting feedback\u201d which can be used when the model consists of a number of coupled modules, with only some of the modules being misspecified. Cutting feedback methods represent the full posterior distribution in terms of conditional and sequential components, and then modify some terms in such a representation based on the modular structure for specification or computation of a modified posterior distribution. The main goal of this is to avoid contamination of inferences for parameters of interest by misspecified modules. Computation for cut posterior distributions is challenging, and here we consider cutting feedback for likelihood-free inference based on Gaussian mixture approximations to the joint distribution of parameters and data summary statistics. We exploit the fact that marginal and conditional distributions of a Gaussian mixture are Gaussian mixtures to give explicit approximations to marginal or conditional posterior distributions so that we can easily approximate cut posterior analyses. The mixture approach allows repeated approximation of posterior distributions for different data based on a single mixture fit. This is important for model checks which aid in the decision of whether to \u201ccut\u201d. A semi-modular approach to likelihood-free inference where feedback is partially cut is also developed. The benefits of the method are illustrated on two challenging examples, a collective cell spreading model and a continuous time model for asset returns with jumps.</p>", "output_year": 2023, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Modularized Bayesian analyses and cutting feedback in likelihood-free inference", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Chakraborty, A, Nott, DJ, Drovandi, CC, Frazier, DT & Sisson, SA 2023, 'Modularized Bayesian analyses and cutting feedback in likelihood-free inference', Statistics and Computing, vol. 33, no. 1, 33. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11222-023-10207-5", "output_keywords": "Synthetic likelihood | Approximate Bayesian computation | Model misspecification | Modularization | Semi-modular inference", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Computational Theory and Mathematics | Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty | Statistics and Probability | Theoretical Computer Science", "output_id": 437421064, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85146599532", "journal_title": "Statistics and Computing", "journal_issn_list": "0960-3174", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 4, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 5, "internal_author_list": "Frazier, David Tyler", "external_author_list": "Chakraborty, Atlanta | Drovandi, Christopher C. | Nott, David John | Sisson, Scott A.", "external_author_org_list": "National University of Singapore | Queensland University of Technology (QUT) | University of New South Wales (UNSW)", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": 25.575197219848633, "y": 0.08263280987739563}, {"output_uuid": "f85b226f-8312-44f0-811c-8c2c7c847911", "Abstract": "<p>This paper introduces an alternate measure of idiosyncratic risk leveraged from the decomposition method to further eliminate the residual systematic risk inherent in the factor asset pricing model.

This study aimed to determine: (i) whether the introduction of the lockout laws was the point at which the time pattern of the assault series in the KX and CBD entertainment precincts changed; (ii) whether the apparent reduction in assault in these precincts persists when we control for common variations in assault across the entire state of NSW; (iii) whether the reduction in assault in the KX and CBD entertainment precincts resulted in a displacement of the assault problem into other areas; and (iv) whether there is a net reduction in assault after taking any spill-over or displacement effects into account. Design: Structural break analysis was used to determine the date at which the time pattern of assaults changed. Interrupted time series analysis with a rest-of-NSW comparator was used to assess the change in assault. Setting, cases and measurements: The monthly totals of incidents of non-domestic assaults reported to the NSW Police between January 2009 and March 2019 (n = 123). Findings: The structural break in assaults occurred in January 2014 rather than in February 2014, when the lockout laws were introduced. The reduction in assault persists even when we control for common influences across NSW as a whole. In particular, from January 2014 onwards, assaults fell immediately by 22% (a downward step) in KX (90% confidence interval [CI] = 15\u201328) and by 33% in the CBD (90% CI = 19\u201347). Assaults continued declining in KX (trend-break coefficient = \u22120.094, 90% CI = \u22120.192 to 0.005). The reduction in assault in the KX and CBD precincts is associated with a rise in assault in areas surrounding these precincts. The net effect, nonetheless, remains a lower level of assault. In particular, we estimate that the net reduction over the three areas combined was 1670 assaults (i.e. 27 per month).

Frequently, such data exhibit nonlinear trends over time potentially due to complex relationships between observed and auxiliary variables, and there may also be sudden declines over time due to major disturbances. This poses substantial challenges for modeling such data and also for adaptive monitoring. To address this, we propose methods for finding adaptive designs for monitoring in such settings. This work is motivated by a monitoring program that has been established at Scott Reef; a coral reef off the Western coast of Australia. Data collected for monitoring the health of Scott Reef are considered, and semiparametric and interrupted time series modeling approaches are adopted to describe how these data vary over time. New methods are then proposed that enable adaptive monitoring designs to be found based on such modeling approaches. These methods are then applied to find future monitoring designs at Scott Reef where it was found that future information gain is expected to be similar across a variety of different sites, suggesting that no particular location needs to be prioritized at Scott Reef for the next monitoring phase. In addition, it was found that omitting some sampling sites/reef locations was possible without substantial loss in expected information gain, depending upon the disturbances that were observed. The resulting adaptive designs are used to form recommendations for future monitoring in this region, and for reefs where changes in the current monitoring practices are being sought.

Combining multiple forecasts produced for a target time series is now widely used to improve accuracy through the integration of information gleaned from different sources, thereby avoiding the need to identify a single \u201cbest\u201d forecast. Combination schemes have evolved from simple combination methods without estimation to sophisticated techniques involving time-varying weights, nonlinear combinations, correlations among components, and cross-learning. They include combining point forecasts and combining probabilistic forecasts. This paper provides an up-to-date review of the extensive literature on forecast combinations and a reference to available open-source software implementations.

First, we propose an Autoregressive moving average model with mixed frequency exogenous variable to analyse the different impacts of oil on airline stock returns on daily, weekly, and monthly basis. We consistently find a negative oil-airline stock return nexus on a daily basis, but a positive relationship on a weekly basis. While the former supports the economic-based channel, the latter is in line with the market inertia channel. Our findings help explain mixed results reported in the literature. Further, our time frequency connectedness analysis shows that the economic-based channel dominates the market inertia channel since the connectedness is more pronounced in the short-run compared to the medium- and long-run. Our block connectedness results highlight that business models of airline firms can play a significant role in affecting the connectedness, in which the low-cost airlines are more sensitive to the oil price changes. It is worth noting that there are distinguished drivers of the oil-airline stock return nexus in different time frequencies. The drivers also vary between the Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.

To address this limitation, the proposed 2-LVAR model adopts a data-driven principle, as in a sparse VAR (SVAR) model, to offer more flexibility in the parametric structure. A two-step estimation strategy is developed accordingly to resolve the challenging objective function of 2-LVAR, which consists of non-standard L2 and LASSO-type penalties with constraints. Using empirical data from Australia, the United Kingdom, France, and Switzerland, we show that the 2-LVAR model outperforms the LC, STAR, and SVAR models in most of our forecasting results. Further simulation studies confirm this outperformance, and analyses based on life expectancy at birth empirically support the existence of age coherence. The results of this paper will help researchers understand the mortality projections in the long run and improve the reserving/ratemaking accuracy for life insurers.", "output_year": 2022, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Forecasting mortality rates with a two-step LASSO based vector autoregressive model", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Kularatne, TD, Li, J & Shi, Y 2022, 'Forecasting mortality rates with a two-step LASSO based vector autoregressive model', Risks, vol. 10, no. 11, 219. https://doi.org/10.3390/risks10110219", "output_keywords": "age-coherence | LASSO | cohort effects | Lee\u2013Carter model | mortality forecasting | adaptive weights", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": null, "output_id": 416097404, "publication_import_source": null, "publication_import_id": null, "journal_title": "Risks", "journal_issn_list": "2227-9091", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 2, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 3, "internal_author_list": "Li, Ka Ki Jackie", "external_author_list": "Kularatne, Thilini Dulanjali | Shi, Yanlin", "external_author_org_list": "Macquarie University", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": -4.5616607666015625, "y": 18.757179260253906}, {"output_uuid": "75cd6f54-4e33-4c93-999c-3856b509618c", "Abstract": "One complication in mortality modelling is capturing the impact of risk factors that contribute to mortality differentials between different populations.

The original HS model was applied to pension data at individual level in the age dimension only. This paper extends the method to model population mortality in both age and period dimensions.

This study examines the effect on Melbourne prices, rents and transactions of these fires from 2005 to mid-2019. The dynamics of prices and rents provide important information about the extent to which the housing market reaction was driven by safety or financial concerns.

Thus, we conclude that the main factor driving the housing market reaction was financial concerns.

This is particularly common in forecasting where some variables are aggregates of others, commonly referred to as hierarchical time series, but also arises in other prediction settings. For point forecasting, an increasingly popular technique is reconciliation, whereby forecasts are made for all series (so-called base forecasts) and subsequently adjusted to cohere with the constraints. We extend reconciliation from point forecasting to probabilistic forecasting. A novel definition of reconciliation is developed and used to construct densities and draw samples from a reconciled probabilistic forecast. In the elliptical case, we prove that true predictive distributions can be recovered using reconciliation even when the location and scale of base predictions are chosen arbitrarily. Reconciliation weights are estimated to optimise energy or variogram score. The log score is not considered since it is improper when comparing unreconciled to reconciled forecasts, a result also proved in this paper.

From the mathematical point of view, usually the LF calculation can be abstracted as a density estimation problem in the bounded domain of {Z1<z<Z2,L>flim(z)} . We use the transformation-reflection KDE method ( \u03c6) to solve the problem, and introduce an approximate method ( \u03c61) based on one-dimensional KDE to deal with the small sample size case. In practical applications, the different versions of LF estimators can be flexibly chosen according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test criterion. Based on 200 simulated samples, we find that for both cases of dividing or not dividing redshift bins, especially for the latter, our method performs significantly better than the traditional binning method \u03c6bin . Moreover, with the increase of sample size n, our LF estimator converges to the true LF remarkably faster than \u03c6bin . To implement our method, we have developed a public, open-source Python toolkit, called kdeLF. With the support of kdeLF, our KDE method is expected to be a competitive alternative to existing nonparametric estimators, due to its high accuracy and excellent stability. kdeLF is available online at GitHub with further extensive documentation available. </p>", "output_year": 2022, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "A flexible method for estimating luminosity functions via kernel density Estimation.

More recently, researchers have explored various approaches for efficiently comparing empirical distributions of the data in the likelihood-free context in an effort to avoid data summarisation. This article provides a review of these full data distance based approaches, and conducts the first comprehensive comparison of such methods, both qualitatively and empirically. We also conduct a substantive empirical comparison with summary statistic based likelihood-free methods. The discussion and results offer guidance to practitioners considering a likelihood-free approach. Whilst we find the best approach to be problem dependent, we also find that the full data distance based approaches are promising and warrant further development. We discuss some opportunities for future research in this space.

Synthetic likelihood is one approach for carrying out inference when the likelihood is intractable, but it is straightforward to simulate from the model. The method constructs an approximate likelihood by taking a vector summary statistic as being multivariate normal, with the unknown mean and covariance estimated by simulation. Previous research demonstrates that the Bayesian implementation of synthetic likelihood can be more computationally efficient than approximate Bayesian computation, a popular likelihood-free method, in the presence of a high-dimensional summary statistic. Our article makes three contributions. The first shows that if the summary statistics are well-behaved, then the synthetic likelihood posterior is asymptotically normal and yields credible sets with the correct level of coverage. The second contribution compares the computational efficiency of Bayesian synthetic likelihood and approximate Bayesian computation. We show that Bayesian synthetic likelihood is computationally more efficient than approximate Bayesian computation. Based on the asymptotic results, the third contribution proposes using adjusted inference methods when a possibly misspecified form is assumed for the covariance matrix of the synthetic likelihood, such as diagonal or a factor model, to speed up computation.

Previous estimates in Australia have relied on single-site studies, or combinations thereof, which have suggested the burden of these infections is high in Australia. Here, we estimate the burden of five healthcare associated infections (HAIs) in Australian public hospitals using a standard international framework, and compare these estimates to those observed in Europe. Methods: We used data from an Australian point prevalence survey to estimate the burden of HAIs amongst adults in Australian public hospitals using an incidence-based approach, introduced by the ECDC Burden of Communicable Diseases in Europe. Results: We estimate that 170,574 HAIs occur in adults admitted to public hospitals in Australia annually, resulting in 7583 deaths. Hospital acquired pneumonia is the most frequent HAI, followed by surgical site infections, and urinary tract infections. We find that blood stream infections contribute a small percentage of HAIs, but contribute the highest number of deaths (3207), more than twice that of the second largest, while pneumonia has the higher impact on years lived with disability. Conclusion: This study is the first time the national burden of HAIs has been estimated for Australia from point prevalence data collected using validated surveillance definitions. Per-capita, estimates are similar to that observed in Europe, but with significantly higher occurrences of bloodstream infections and healthcare-associated pneumonia, primarily amongst women. Overall, the estimated burden is high and highlights the need for continued investment in HAI prevention.</p>", "output_year": 2022, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Burden of five healthcare associated infections in Australia", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Lydeamore, MJ, Mitchell, BG, Bucknall, T, Cheng, AC, Russo, PL & Stewardson, AJ 2022, 'Burden of five healthcare associated infections in Australia', Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control, vol. 11, no. 1, 69. https://doi.org/10.1186/s13756-022-01109-8", "output_keywords": "Infection control | Epidemiology | Healthcare associated infections | Nosocomial infection", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Infectious Diseases | Microbiology (medical) | Pharmacology (medical) | Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "output_id": 391648495, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85130056554", "journal_title": "Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control", "journal_issn_list": "2047-2994", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 0, "output_author_count_internal": 6, "output_author_count_total": 6, "internal_author_list": "Bucknall, Tracey Katherine | Cheng, Allen Cheuk-Seng | Lydeamore, Michael John | Mitchell, Brett | Russo, Philip | Stewardson, Andrew James", "external_author_list": null, "external_author_org_list": "Alfred Hospital | Avondale University College Limited (trading as Avondale University) | Cabrini Health Limited | Deakin University | University of Newcastle", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": 13.040096282958984, "y": -18.3597469329834}, {"output_uuid": "2fc3571f-737a-404a-b9ea-fce0b57e39dd", "Abstract": "<p>Online retailers often sell products using a socially competitive second-price sealed-bid auction known as a Vickrey auction (VA), an incentivized demand-revealing mechanism used to elicit players' subjective values. The VA presents a situation of risky decision-making, which typically implements value processing and a loss aversion mechanism. Neural outcome processing of VA bids are not known; this study explores this for the first time using EEG. Twenty-eight healthy participants bid on household items against an anonymous, computerized opponent. Bid outcome event-related potentials were predicted to differentiate between three conditions: outbid (no-win), large margin win (bargain), and small margin win (snatch). Individual loss aversion values were evaluated in a separate behavioral experiment offering gains or losses of variable amounts but equal chances against an assured gain. Processing outcomes of VA bids were associated with a feedback-related negativity (FRN) potential with a spatial maximum at the vertex (251\u2013271 ms), where bargain win trials resulted in greater FRN amplitudes than snatch win trials. Additionally, a P300 potential was sensitive to win versus no-win outcomes and to retail price. Individual loss aversion level did not correlate with the strength of FRN or P300. Results show that outcome processing in a VA is associated with FRN that differentiates between relatively advantageous and less advantageous gains, and a P300 that distinguishes between the more and less expensive auction items.

The Lee-Carter model is one of the widely applied mortality models proposed to capture and predict the trend in mortality reductions. However, some studies have identified the presence of structural changes in historical mortality data, which makes the forecasting performance of mortality models sensitive to the calibration period. Although some attention has been paid to investigating the time or period effects of structural shifts, the potential time-varying age patterns are often overlooked. This paper proposes a new approach that applies a Fourier series with time-varying parameters to the age sensitivity factor in the Lee-Carter model to study the evolution of age effects. Since modelling the age effects is separated from modelling the period effects, the proposed model can incorporate these two sources of structural changes into mortality predictions.

The analysis is supplemented with a numerical study of longevity trend bonds, using different mortality models and population data. The numerical study reveals that for these mortality-linked securities the three pairs of cdf's generally have unique pairwise crossing points. Under symmetric copulas, all crossing points can reasonably be approximated by the difference of the marginal medians, but this approximation is not necessarily valid for asymmetric copulas. Nevertheless, extreme dependence structures can give rise to bounds if the layers of the bond are selected to hedge tail risk.

The other extreme dependence situation, involving the sum of two arbitrary counter-monotonic random variables, presents a certain number of challenges. One of them is that it is not straightforward to express the VaR of a counter-monotonic sum in terms of the VaRs of the marginal components of the sum.

Under joint normality of the error terms, IV Probit maximum likelihood estimation does identify the average partial effect of X. The two-step control function procedure of Rivers and Vuong can also estimate this causal parameter consistently, but a double averaging is needed, one over the distribution of the first-stage error V and one over the distribution of X. If instead a single averaging is performed over the joint distribution of X and V, then the same causal parameter is estimated as the one estimated by the 2SLS estimator in the linear probability model. The 2SLS estimator is a consistent estimator when the average partial effect is equal to 0, and the standard Wald test for this hypothesis has correct size under strong instrument asymptotics.

Unlike the classical regime-switching models which only allow model parameters to change upon regime switches, our framework allows, more importantly, model structures to vary. With mild assumptions on the characteristic function of the log-stock price, our model settings enable the study of fundamental features of the market dynamics, such as stochastic volatility and jumps, on the underlying fund value of GMMB in a unified framework. This novel idea is illustrated by a three-regime model whose environments can be characterised by either the geometric Brownian motion process, the Heston (1993) stochastic volatility process, or double exponential process. Three versions of the GMMB riders are considered; a fixed or roll-up guarantee, a geometric average guarantee and a ratchet guarantee. With the Fourier Cosine (COS) method which utilises characteristic functions, explicit valuation expressions for various contracts are derived, and numerical illustrations are performed to analyse the efficiency of the approach in terms of computational speed and accuracy. The paper makes a unique contribution by presenting regime-dependent bounds and an algorithm for determining the optimal grid points required for the COS method to achieve a specific level of accuracy. Numerical experiments for the valuation framework reveal that i) as the likelihood of regime shifts increases, the price difference of VA contracts with different initial regimes diminishes, which is consistent with financial intuition; ii) the generalised regime-switching models are more suitable for VA pricing when the time-to-maturity spans over several decades, during which structural changes, although infrequent, are inevitable.</p>", "output_year": 2022, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Valuation of guaranteed minimum maturity benefits under generalised regime-switching models using the Fourier Cosine method", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Kang, B, Shen, Y, Zhu, D & Ziveyi, J 2022, 'Valuation of guaranteed minimum maturity benefits under generalised regime-switching models using the Fourier Cosine method', Insurance: Mathematics and Economics, vol. 105, pp. 96-127. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.insmatheco.2022.03.012", "output_keywords": "GMMB | Ratchet options | COS method | Variable annuity contracts | Generalised regime-switching model", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty | Economics and Econometrics | Statistics and Probability", "output_id": 378156184, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85128165623", "journal_title": "Insurance: Mathematics and Economics", "journal_issn_list": "0167-6687", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 3, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 4, "internal_author_list": "Zhu, Dan", "external_author_list": "Kang, Boda | Shen, Yang | Ziveyi, Jonathan", "external_author_org_list": "AMP Limited | University of New South Wales (UNSW)", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": 11, "x": 33.73643112182617, "y": 19.7697811126709}, {"output_uuid": "871e30f9-8d4e-4621-bda6-1adb17b0acdc", "Abstract": "<p>Multivariate data is often visualized using linear projections, produced by techniques such as principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and projection pursuit. A problem with projections is that they obscure low and high density regions near the center of the distribution. Sections, or slices, can help to reveal them. This article develops a section pursuit method, building on the extensive work in projection pursuit, to search for interesting slices of the data. Linear projections are used to define sections of the parameter space, and to calculate interestingness by comparing the distribution of observations, inside and outside a section. By optimizing this index, it is possible to reveal features such as holes (low density) or grains (high density). The optimization is incorporated into a guided tour so that the search for structure can be dynamic. The approach can be useful for problems when data distributions depart from uniform or normal, as in visually exploring nonlinear manifolds, and functions in multivariate space. Two applications of section pursuit are shown: exploring decision boundaries from classification models, and exploring subspaces induced by complex inequality conditions from a multiple parameter model. The new methods are available in R, in the tourr package.

Projection pursuit is a generalisation of principal component analysis in the sense that different indexes are used to define the interestingness of the projected data. While much work has been done in developing new indexes in the literature, less has been done on understanding the optimisation. Index functions can be noisy, might have multiple local maxima as well as an optimal maximum, and are constrained to generate orthonormal projection frames, which complicates the optimization. In addition, projection pursuit is primarily used for exploratory data analysis, and finding the local maxima is also useful. The guided tour is especially useful for exploration because it conducts geodesic interpolation connecting steps in the optimisation and shows how the projected data changes as a maxima is approached. This work provides new visual diagnostics for examining a choice of optimisation procedure based on the provision of a new data object which collects information throughout the optimisation.

However, it has been suggested that this population presents and lives with underestimated cardiovascular risk factors at a younger age, hence affecting their overall health and quality of life and contributing to early mortality. We assessed autonomic nervous system function in subjects with ID (n = 39), aged 18-45yr, through measures of sudomotor function, heart rate and systolic blood pressure variability, and cardiac baroreflex function. Traditional clinical cardiovascular measurements and a biochemical analysis were also undertaken. We found that young adults with ID presented with sudomotor dysfunction, impaired cardiac baroreflex sensitivity, and systolic blood pressure variability, when compared with age-matched control subjects (n = 38). Reduced hand and feet electrochemical skin conductance and asymmetry were significantly associated with having a moderate-profound ID.

In this article, we further study this concept in several aspects. First, we consider options written on parametric mortality indexes. Such options enable hedgers to create out-of-the-money longevity hedges, which, compared to at-the-money-hedges created with q-/K-forwards, may better meet hedgers\u2019 needs for protection against downside risk. Second, using the properties of the time series processes for the parametric mortality indexes, we derive analytical risk-neutral pricing formulas for K-forwards and options. In addition to convenience, the analytical pricing formulas remove the need for computationally intensive nested simulations that are entailed in, for example, the calculation of the hedging instruments\u2019 values when a dynamic hedge is adjusted.

Benchmarking MFs against peers also do receive considerable attention in MF performance appraisal literature. Evidence of data envelopment analysis (DEA) playing a big part here is increasing. DEA appraises performance in a multidimensional framework and can accommodate data from different sources and in different formats. A question that arise is how to extract information of value from data in DEA-based performance appraisal. This chapter discusses contribution of network DEA in MF performance appraisal in general and highlight that when MF management process is conceptualised as a network structure, it is possible to extract valuable information from MF specific data analogous to data mining in the case of big data. Information of value in this context aligns with the concept of value dimension in big data. MF performance appraisal studies that use DEA demonstrate how different types of network structures can reveal performance from different perspectives such as operational management, marketing and selling management, disbursements (cost, expenses and fees) management, and portfolio management. Network DEA models enable decomposition of overall management performance at individual sub-process levels. This is valuable information to MF managers to make effective decisions, as they are able to gauge how their MFs operate at sub-process levels from different overall management perspectives. This chapter highlights that information extracted through MF performance appraisal using network DEA is practical and such knowledge inspires solutions to MF management problems in the real world. Moreover, information extracted via such application is valuable to all stakeholders including MF investors to face up to many challenges in managed fund industry landscape.</p>", "output_year": 2021, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Chapter in Book/Report/Conference proceeding", "output_subtype": "Chapter (Book)", "output_title": "Value extracting in relative performance appraisal with network DEA", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Fukuyama, H & Galagedera, DUA 2021, Value extracting in relative performance appraisal with network DEA: an application to U.S. equity mutual funds. in J Zhu & V Charles (eds), Data-Enabled Analytics: DEA for Big Data. 1st edn, International Series in Operations Research and Management Science, vol. 312, Springer, Cham Switzerland, pp. 263-297. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-75162-3_10", "output_keywords": "Network DEA application | Big data analytics | Mutual fund performance", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Strategy and Management | Computer Science Applications | Software | Management Science and Operations Research | Applied Mathematics", "output_id": 368819020, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85122433622", "journal_title": null, "journal_issn_list": null, "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 1, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 2, "internal_author_list": "Galagedera, Don Upatissa Asoka", "external_author_list": "Fukuyama, Hirofumi", "external_author_org_list": "Fukuoka University", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": 12, "x": -2.1926980018615723, "y": -17.763166427612305}, {"output_uuid": "3a7fd22b-ea2b-4bcf-8365-61de79746f1b", "Abstract": "<p>In this paper, we propose a network-based analytical framework that exploits cointegration and the error correction model to systematically investigate the directions and intensities in terms of the short-run disequilibrium adjustment towards long-run equilibrium affecting the international stock markets during the period of 5 January 2007 to 30 June 2017.

In 72% of cases with missing point data, predicted values were within the sensor precision interval of the original value, although predictive ability declined when sequences of missing data occurred. Precision also depended on the availability of other water quality covariates. When covariates were available, even a sudden, event-based peak in nitrate concentration was reconstructed well.

However, they can be computationally demanding. Bayesian synthetic likelihood (BSL) is a popular such method that approximates the likelihood function of the summary statistic with a known, tractable distribution\u2014typically Gaussian\u2014and then performs statistical inference using standard likelihood-based techniques. However, as the number of summary statistics grows, the number of model simulations required to accurately estimate the covariance matrix for this likelihood rapidly increases. This poses a significant challenge for the application of BSL, especially in cases where model simulation is expensive. In this article, we propose whitening BSL (wBSL)\u2014an efficient BSL method that uses approximate whitening transformations to decorrelate the summary statistics at each algorithm iteration.

At the finest resolution, we visualize methylation patterns across individual reads along the genome using the spaghetti plot and heatmaps, allowing users to explore particular genes or genomic regions of interest.

It further examines gender heterogeneity in the adaptation to (anticipated or actual) spousal bereavement, comparing objective evidence with subjective evidence of cognitive abilities. We used longitudinal data of up to 26,584 participants of the Health and Retirement Study, aged over 50 at recruitment, assessed biennially between 1998 and 2016. Two-way fixed effects with dynamic treatment effects were estimated for various cognitive measures, including six aggregated indices and six single item scales. After adjusting for effect channels including depression, social vulnerability, and stress, there remained significant widowhood effects on older adults\u2019 cognitive health. Using single item scales, we established the adverse contemporaneous and adaptation effects on bereaved older females\u2019 short-term memory, semantic memory, and numeracy.

Writing fast inference code for a complex spatial model with realistically-sized datasets from scratch is time-consuming, and if changes are made to the model, there is little guarantee that the code performs well. The key advantages of R-INLA are the ease with which complex models can be created and modified, without the need to write complex code, and the speed at which inference can be done even for spatial problems with hundreds of thousands of observations. R-INLA handles latent Gaussian models, where fixed effects, structured and unstructured Gaussian random effects are combined linearly in a linear predictor, and the elements of the linear predictor are observed through one or more likelihoods. The structured random effects can be both standard areal model such as the Besag and the BYM models, and geostatistical models from a subset of the Mat\u00e9rn Gaussian random fields. In this review, we discuss the large success of spatial modeling with R-INLA and the types of spatial models that can be fitted, we give an overview of recent developments for areal models, and we give an overview of the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach and some of the ways it can be extended beyond the assumptions of isotropy and separability. In particular, we describe how slight changes to the SPDE approach leads to straight-forward approaches for nonstationary spatial models and nonseparable space\u2013time models.

This article describes classes of time deconstructions using linear and cyclic time granularities. Linear granularities respect the linear progression of time such as hours, days, weeks and months. Cyclic granularities can be circular such as hour-of-the-day, quasi-circular such as day-of-the-month, and aperiodic such as public holidays. The hierarchical structure of granularities creates a nested ordering: hour-of-the-day and second-of-the-minute are single-order-up. Hour-of-the-week is multiple-order-up, because it passes over day-of-the-week. Methods are provided for creating all possible granularities for a time index. A recommendation algorithm provides an indication whether a pair of granularities can be meaningfully examined together (a \u201charmony\u201d), or when they cannot (a \u201cclash\u201d). Time granularities can be used to create data visualizations to explore for periodicities, associations and anomalies. The granularities form categorical variables (ordered or unordered) which induce groupings of the observations. Assuming a numeric response variable, the resulting graphics are then displays of distributions compared across combinations of categorical variables.

This study analyzes its propagation and evaluates statistically the effect of mobility restriction policies on the spread of the disease. Methods We apply a variation of the stochastic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model to describe the temporal-spatial evolution of the disease across 33 provincial regions in China, where the disease was first identified. We employ Bayesian Markov Chain Monte-Carlo methods to estimate the model and to characterize a dynamic transmission network, which enables us to evaluate the effectiveness of various local and national policies. Results The spread of the disease in China was predominantly driven by community transmission within regions, which dropped substantially after local governments imposed various lockdown policies. Further, Hubei was only the epicenter of the early epidemic stage. Secondary epicenters, such as Beijing and Guangdong, had already become established by late January 2020. The transmission from these epicenters substantially declined following the introduction of mobility restrictions across regions. Conclusions The spatial transmission network is able to differentiate the effect of the local lockdown policies and the cross-region mobility restrictions. We conclude that both are important policy tools for curbing the disease transmission. The coordination between central and local governments is important in suppressing the spread of infectious diseases.</p>", "output_year": 2021, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "The effect of human mobility restrictions on the COVID-19 transmission network in China", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Oka, T, Wei, W & Zhu, D 2021, 'The effect of human mobility restrictions on the COVID-19 transmission network in China', PLoS ONE, vol. 16, no. 7, e0254403. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254403", "output_keywords": null, "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "General", "output_id": 346732489, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85110724282", "journal_title": "PLoS ONE", "journal_issn_list": "1932-6203", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 0, "output_author_count_internal": 3, "output_author_count_total": 3, "internal_author_list": "Oka, Tatsushi | Wei, Wei | Zhu, Dan", "external_author_list": null, "external_author_org_list": null, "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": -3.4923036098480225, "y": 16.46953010559082}, {"output_uuid": "3db3149b-bef9-4fe1-9c64-20ca8ed17879", "Abstract": "<p>A general and flexible class of latent Gaussian models is proposed in this paper.

We also find that more stringent environmental policies seem to render a country's use of intermediate inputs more inelastic to their own prices and decrease the substitutability between labor and intermediate inputs in the long run. We argue that more stringent environmental policies would exert tighter control over the use of several intermediate inputs such as energy, raw materials, pollution-intensive services etc., leading to the use of these inputs being less sensitive to changes in their market prices.

The welfare consequences of price shocks though are well understood yet the policy responses to manage these remain blurred because of a lack of clarity on their causes. Focusing on onions that comprise an important constituent of the Indian diet, the purpose of this paper is to explore causes of high price volatility. Design/methodology/approach: Using high-frequency time series data on wholesale prices and arrivals of onions in major markets and other relevant variables, this paper analyzes causes of price volatility from several angles, that is production shocks, seasonality in production and market arrivals, internal trade, export policies and market power of intermediaries on the supply chain. Findings: Despite markets being integrated and no significant climatic shocks to production there exists a strong element of uncertainty in market arrivals of onions, pointing toward the market power immediate downstream the production or alternatively anti-competition trade practices in major markets as a cause of high price volatility. The measures to manage price volatility, such as an increase in minimum export prices and bans on exports, are also not found to have an immediate cooling effect on prices. Research limitations/implications: The agricultural policy should provide for a system of market intelligence to monitor anti-competitive trade practices along the supply chain, and to take proactive trade control measures to prevent frequent ups and downs in domestic prices. In addition, it should provide for incentives for developing efficient supply chains and for the cultivation of onions in the regions that have agronomic potential but it has remained underexploited due to one or the other constraint. Social implications: Excessive volatility in food prices impacts farmers, consumers, processors, and traders and even political system. It may distort production and investment decisions of farmers and intermediaries on the value chains, leading to inefficient allocation of resources. The poor consumers may be forced to reduce food and non-food productive expenditures. If persists for a longer period, it may lead to political instability too. Originality/value: Several studies have analyzed volatility in food prices and causes thereof. However, rarely any of these has examined volatility in prices of perishable high-value food commodities.

Variational inference methods provide an attractive solution. These methods use an approximation to the posterior density, yet for large latent variable models existing choices can be inaccurate or slow to calibrate. Here, we propose a family of tractable variational approximations that are more accurate and faster to calibrate for this case. It combines a parsimonious approximation for the parameter posterior with the exact conditional posterior of the latent variables. We derive a simplified expression for the re-parameterization gradient of the variational lower bound, which is the main ingredient of optimization algorithms used for calibration. Implementation only requires exact or approximate generation from the conditional posterior of the latent variables, rather than computation of their density. In effect, our method provides a new way to employ Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) within variational inference. We illustrate using two complex contemporary econometric examples. The first is a nonlinear multivariate state space model for U.S. macroeconomic variables. The second is a random coefficients tobit model applied to two million sales by 20,000 individuals in a consumer panel.

We propose a new model, the Barrier model, which is different from the established methods as it is not based on the shortest distance around the physical barrier, nor on boundary conditions. The Barrier model is based on viewing the Mat\u00e9rn correlation, not as a correlation function on the shortest distance between two points, but as a collection of paths through a Simultaneous Autoregressive (SAR) model. We then manipulate these local dependencies to cut off paths that are crossing the physical barriers. To make the new SAR well behaved, we formulate it as a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) that can be discretised to represent the Gaussian field, with a sparse precision matrix that is automatically positive definite. The main advantage with the Barrier model is that the computational cost is the same as for the stationary model. The model is easy to use, and can deal with both sparse data and very complex barriers, as shown in an application in the Finnish Archipelago Sea.

Understanding the heterogeneity in state-level mortality experience is of fundamental importance, as it can assist decision making for policymakers, health authorities, as well as local communities who are seeking to reduce inequalities and disparities in life expectancy. A key challenge of multi-population mortality modeling is high dimensionality, and the resulting complex dependence structures across sub-populations. Moreover, when projecting future mortality rates, it is important to ensure that the state-level forecasts are coherent with the national-level forecasts. We address these issues by first obtaining independent state-level forecasts based on classical stochastic mortality models, and then incorporating the dependence structure in the forecast reconciliation process. Both traditional bottom-up reconciliation and the cutting-edge trace minimization reconciliation methods are considered. Based on the U.S. total mortality data for the period 1969\u20132017, we project the 10-year-ahead mortality rates at both national-level and state-level up to 2027.

A demand function for durable goods is derived in an adjustment cost framework. The consumption growth equation accounts for relative price effects with precautionary saving, durables stock, and liquidity constraints.

Despite a considerable body of research in the area of forecasting, the focus has largely been on the financial and economic outcomes of the forecasting process as opposed to societal benefits. Our motivation in this study is to promote the latter, with a view to using the forecasting process to advance social and environmental objectives such as equality, social justice and sustainability. We refer to such forecasting practices as Forecasting for Social Good (FSG) where the benefits to society and the environment take precedence over economic and financial outcomes. We conceptualise FSG and discuss its scope and boundaries in the context of the \u201cDoughnut theory\u201d. We present some key attributes that qualify a forecasting process as FSG: it is concerned with a real problem; it is focused on advancing social and environmental goals and prioritises these over conventional measures of economic success; and it has a broad societal impact. We also position FSG in the wider literature on forecasting and social good practices. We propose an FSG maturity framework as the means to engage academics and practitioners with research in this area. Finally, we highlight that FSG: (i) cannot be distilled to a prescriptive set of guidelines, (ii) is scalable, and (iii) has the potential to make significant contributions to advancing social objectives.</p>", "output_year": 2022, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Forecasting for social good", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Rostami-Tabar, B, Ali, MM, Hong, T, Hyndman, RJ, Porter, MD & Syntetos, A 2022, 'Forecasting for social good', International Journal of Forecasting, vol. 38, no. 3, pp. 1245-1257. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijforecast.2021.02.010", "output_keywords": "Forecasting | Sustainability | Ecological ceiling | Social foundation | Social good", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Business and International Management", "output_id": 336571965, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85103701509", "journal_title": "International Journal of Forecasting", "journal_issn_list": "0169-2070", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 5, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 6, "internal_author_list": "Hyndman, Robin John", "external_author_list": "Ali, Mohammad | Hong, Tao | Porter, Michael D. | Rostami-Tabar, Bahman | Syntetos, Aris", "external_author_org_list": "Cardiff University | University of East London | University of North Carolina at Charlotte | University of Virginia", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": -42.53901672363281, "y": -2.5678629875183105}, {"output_uuid": "b3cf497c-b157-445a-8144-c1c5c686b49c", "Abstract": "<p>Both time- and frequency-domain solution techniques are developed for determining the response of linear multi-degree-of-freedom systems exhibiting singular parameter matrices and endowed with derivative terms of noninteger orders modeled as rational numbers.

No individual SF is disbursement efficient in all five sampled years. Generally, SFs manage disbursements poorly compared to risk in return generation.

Only reads overlapping annotated exons are considered to be informative since mature mRNA is assumed to be the major component sequenced, especially for poly(A) RNA libraries. In this study, we show that intron reads are informative, and through exploratory data analysis of read coverage that intron signal is representative of both pre-mRNAs and intron retention. We demonstrate how intron reads can be utilized in differential expression analysis using our index method where a unique set of differentially expressed genes can be detected using intron counts.

Unfortunately however, IBD analyses have been underutilized in analysis of other organisms, including human pathogens. This is in part due to the lack of statistical methodologies for non-diploid genomes in addition to the added complexity of multiclonal infections. As such, we have developed an IBD methodology, called isoRelate, for analysis of haploid recombining microorganisms in the presence of multiclonal infections. Using the inferred IBD status at genomic locations, we have also developed a novel statistic for identifying loci under positive selection and propose relatedness networks as a means of exploring shared haplotypes within populations. We evaluate the performance of our methodologies for detecting IBD and selection, including comparisons with existing tools, then perform an exploratory analysis of whole genome sequencing data from a global Plasmodium falciparum dataset of more than 2500 genomes. This analysis identifies Southeast Asia as having many highly related isolates, possibly as a result of both reduced transmission from intensified control efforts and population bottlenecks following the emergence of antimalarial drug resistance. Many signals of selection are also identified, most of which overlap genes that are known to be associated with drug resistance, in addition to two novel signals observed in multiple countries that have yet to be explored in detail. Additionally, we investigate relatedness networks over the selected loci and determine that one of these sweeps has spread between continents while the other has arisen independently in different countries. IBD analysis of microorganisms using isoRelate can be used for exploring population structure, positive selection and haplotype distributions, and will be a valuable tool for monitoring disease control and elimination efforts of many diseases.</p>", "output_year": 2018, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Identity-by-descent analyses for measuring population dynamics and selection in recombining pathogens", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Henden, L, Lee, S, Mueller, I, Barry, A & Bahlo, M 2018, 'Identity-by-descent analyses for measuring population dynamics and selection in recombining pathogens', PLoS Genetics, vol. 14, no. 5, e1007279. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007279", "output_keywords": null, "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics | Cancer Research | Genetics | Molecular Biology | Genetics(clinical)", "output_id": 333803952, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85048247348", "journal_title": "PLoS Genetics", "journal_issn_list": "1553-7390", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 3, "output_author_count_internal": 2, "output_author_count_total": 5, "internal_author_list": "Lee, Stuart Andrew | Mueller, Ivo", "external_author_list": "Bahlo, Melanie | Barry, Alyssa E. | Henden, Lyndal", "external_author_org_list": "University of Melbourne | Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (WEHI)", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": 19.3492488861084, "y": -20.45844268798828}, {"output_uuid": "1a3a46aa-8ace-4e3a-91fd-3f30b48c85da", "Abstract": "<p>We construct a simple workflow for fluent genomics data analysis using the R/Bioconductor ecosystem.

Barcodes comprising large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are accurate and efficient genotyping tools, however may need to be tailored to specific malaria transmission settings, since \u2018universal\u2019 barcodes can lack resolution at the local scale. A SNP barcode was developed that captures the diversity and structure of Plasmodium vivax populations of Papua New Guinea (PNG) for research and surveillance. Methods: Using 20 high-quality P. vivax genome sequences from PNG, a total of 178 evenly spaced neutral SNPs were selected for development of an amplicon sequencing assay combining a series of multiplex PCRs and sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. For initial testing, 20 SNPs were amplified in a small number of mono- and polyclonal P. vivax infections. The full barcode was then validated by genotyping and population genetic analyses of 94 P. vivax isolates collected between 2012 and 2014 from four distinct catchment areas on the highly endemic north coast of PNG. Diversity and population structure determined from the SNP barcode data was then benchmarked against that of ten microsatellite markers used in previous population genetics studies. Results: From a total of 28,934,460 reads generated from the MiSeq Illumina run, 87% mapped to the PvSalI reference genome with deep coverage (median = 563, range 56\u20137586) per locus across genotyped samples. Of 178 SNPs assayed, 146 produced high-quality genotypes (minimum coverage = 56X) in more than 85% of P. vivax isolates. No amplification bias was introduced due to either polyclonal infection or whole genome amplification (WGA) of samples before genotyping. Compared to the microsatellite panels, the SNP barcode revealed greater variability in genetic diversity between populations and geographical population structure. The SNP barcode also enabled assignment of genotypes according to their geographic origins with a significant association between genetic distance and geographic distance at the sub-provincial level. Conclusions: High-throughput SNP barcoding can be used to map variation of malaria transmission dynamics at sub-national resolution. The low cost per sample and genotyping strategy makes the transfer of this technology to field settings highly feasible.</p>", "output_year": 2020, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "SNP barcodes provide higher resolution than microsatellite markers to measure <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> population genetics", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Fola, AA, Kattenberg, E, Razook, Z, Lautu-Gumal, D, Lee, S, Mehra, S, Bahlo, M, Kazura, J, Robinson, LJ & Laman, M et al. 2020, 'SNP barcodes provide higher resolution than microsatellite markers to measure Plasmodium vivax population genetics', Malaria Journal, vol. 19, 375. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12936-020-03440-0", "output_keywords": "Malaria | Papua New Guinea | Diversity | Plasmodium vivax | Population structure | Microsatellites | Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms\u00a0(SNPs)", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Parasitology | Infectious Diseases", "output_id": 333803421, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85092909605", "journal_title": "Malaria Journal", "journal_issn_list": "1475-2875", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 9, "output_author_count_internal": 3, "output_author_count_total": 12, "internal_author_list": "Lee, Stuart Andrew | Mueller, Ivo | Robinson, Leanne", "external_author_list": "Bahlo, Melanie | Barry, Alyssa E. | Fola, Abebe A. | Kattenberg, Eline | Kazura, James W. | Laman, Moses | Lautu-Gumal, Dulcie | Mehra, Somya | Razook, Zahra", "external_author_org_list": "Burnet Institute (Australia) | Case Western Reserve University | Deakin University | Institut Pasteur (Pasteur Institute) | Instituut voor Tropische Geneeskunde (Antwerp Institute of Tropical Medicine) | Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research | Purdue University West Lafayette | University of Melbourne | Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (WEHI)", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": 12.94147777557373, "y": -19.70911407470703}, {"output_uuid": "f7fe8223-0178-40c9-afce-df9e54c6eed9", "Abstract": "<p>Microplastic contamination of the marine environment has been reported globally.

Concentrated nitric acid was most effective at eliminating biological material from seawater samples. No apparent physical (i.e., length or color) or chemical changes due to separation treatments were observed in recovered high-density polyethylene microparticles, with the one exception that enzymatic digestion obscured polymer identification of high-density polyethylene.

The proposed investigation is motivated by the lack of data-driven methods for simultaneously choosing bandwidths in the local linear estimator of the regression function and kernel-form error density. Treating bandwidths as parameters, we derive an approximate (pseudo) likelihood and a posterior. A simulation study shows that the proposed bandwidth estimation outperforms the rule-of-thumb and cross-validation methods under the criterion of integrated squared errors. The proposed bandwidth estimation method is validated through a nonparametric regression model involving firm ownership concentration, and a model involving state-price density estimation. </p>", "output_year": 2022, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Bayesian bandwidth estimation for local linear fitting in nonparametric regression models", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Shang, HL & Zhang, X 2022, 'Bayesian bandwidth estimation for local linear fitting in nonparametric regression models', Studies in Nonlinear Dynamics and Econometrics, vol. 26, no. 1, pp. 55-71. https://doi.org/10.1515/snde-2018-0050", "output_keywords": "state-price density | Markov chain Monte Carlo | ownership concentration | kernel-form error density", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Economics and Econometrics | Analysis | Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "output_id": 331392649, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85097500108", "journal_title": "Studies in Nonlinear Dynamics and Econometrics", "journal_issn_list": "1558-3708", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 1, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 2, "internal_author_list": "Zhang, Xibin", "external_author_list": "Shang, Han Lin", "external_author_org_list": "Australian National University (ANU) | Macquarie University", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": 41.88498306274414, "y": 7.271139144897461}, {"output_uuid": "a383f982-bc08-419e-9b93-aa49b47243e8", "Abstract": "<p>Either in the form of nature's wrath or a pandemic, catastrophes cause major destructions in societies, thus requiring policy and decisionmakers to take urgent action by evaluating a host of interdependent parameters, and possible scenarios.

In this paper we evaluate within- and between-participant test-retest reliability on a wide range of measures of sentence acceptability. Doing so allows us to estimate how much of the variability within each measure is due to factors including participant-level individual differences, sample size, response styles, and item effects. The measures examined include Likert scales, two versions of forced-choice judgments, magnitude estimation, and a novel measure based on Thurstonian approaches in psychophysics.

Several endogenous and exogenous variables can influence the dynamics of demand, and hence a single statistical model that only consists of historical sales data is often insufficient to produce accurate forecasts. In practice, the forecasts generated by baseline statistical models are often judgmentally adjusted by forecasters to incorporate factors and information that are not incorporated in the baseline models. There are however systematic events whose effect can be quantified and modeled to help minimize human intervention in adjusting the baseline forecasts. In this paper, we develop and test a novel regime-switching approach to quantify systematic information/events and objectively incorporate them into the baseline statistical model. Our simple yet practical and effective model can help limit forecast adjustments to only focus on the impact of less systematic events such as sudden climate change or dynamic market activities. The model is validated empirically using sales and promotional data from two Australian companies. The model is also benchmarked against commonly employed statistical and machine learning forecasting models. Discussions focus on thorough analysis of promotions impact and benchmarking results. We show that the proposed model can successfully improve forecast accuracy and avoid poor forecasts when compared to the current industry practice which heavily relies on human judgment to factor in all types of information/events. The proposed model also outperforms sophisticated machine learning methods by mitigating the generation of extremely poor forecasts that drastically differ from actual sales due to changes in demand states.</p>", "output_year": 2020, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Demand forecasting in the presence of systematic events", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Abolghasemi, M, Hurley, J, Eshragh, A & Fahimnia, B 2020, 'Demand forecasting in the presence of systematic events: cases in capturing sales promotions', International Journal of Production Economics, vol. 230, 107892. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2020.107892", "output_keywords": "Demand forecasting | Supply chain | Sales promotions | Time series regression models | Judgmental forecasting | Systematic events", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Business, Management and Accounting(all) | Management Science and Operations Research | Economics and Econometrics | Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "output_id": 324218984, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85092934974", "journal_title": "International Journal of Production Economics", "journal_issn_list": "0925-5273", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 3, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 4, "internal_author_list": "Abolghasemi, Mahdi", "external_author_list": "Eshragh, Ali | Fahimnia, Behnam | Hurley, Jason", "external_author_org_list": "University of California Berkeley | University of Newcastle | University of Sydney", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": -17.553327560424805, "y": 10.39421558380127}, {"output_uuid": "82d51920-5c0c-4b72-b228-f4d3e74e4945", "Abstract": "<p>In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Hyperbolic EGARCH (A-HYEGARCH) model to estimate the long memory of high frequency time series with potential structural breaks.

The learning and performance outcomes of two groups of postgraduate student participants are investigated namely: (a) participants who do not struggle with the task and (b) participants who do struggle with completing the task. Design/methodology/approach: An experiment was conducted using a simulated business, which was manipulated into two initial commencement formats: positive initial format (PIF) and negative initial format (NIF). Individual performance on the task was measured via achievement of performance targets whilst individual learning was measured via causal cognitive maps. Findings: Participants using PIF did not struggle with completing the task and achieved higher performance outcomes compared to participants using NIF, who struggled with completing the task.

We consider incurred costs and expenses as MF disbursements. We develop a network data envelopment analysis model to assess MF performance from disbursement management perspective and propose new measures of MF performance - disbursement efficiency and disbursement utilization. We do this by conceptualising overall MF management process as a two-stage production process. In a sample of 1,706 U.S. equity MFs, we find that disbursement management performance relative to their peers (disbursement efficiency) is generally poor. Less than one per cent of the MFs are disbursement efficient and they are more likely to be growth funds. MFs that charge high fees perform relatively poorly in disbursement management. Large funds, on average, outperform mid-size and small funds in technical efficiency. According to our modelling framework, technical efficiency does not imply disbursement efficiency. Approximately fifteen per cent of technical efficient MFs are disbursement efficient. This is an indication that MF disbursement inefficiency is an issue that require attention of all stakeholders. Disbursement under-utilization and technical inefficiency explain disbursement inefficiency. For disbursement inefficient MFs, we provide pathways to become efficient in disbursement management. We validate the proposed MF performance measures empirically.</p>", "output_year": 2020, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Do mutual fund managers earn their fees?

Method: Instructions on installation of libraries for R and Python, source codes and links to census data are provided in a notebook format to enhance experience with running the software. The code illustrates different aspects of using geospatial analysis: (1) creation of choropleth (thematic) map which depicts estimate of stroke cases per post codes; (2) use of map to help define service regions for rehabilitation after stroke. Results: Choropleth map showing estimate of stroke per post codes and service boundary map for rehabilitation after stroke.

The simulation experiments reveal that when the weights are constructed using the parameter values of the true data generating process, a version of the optimal jackknife estimator almost always out-performs alternative semi-parametric bias-corrected estimators. A feasible version of the jackknife estimator, in which the weights are constructed using estimates of the unknown parameters, whilst not dominant overall, is still the least biased estimator in some cases. Even when misspecified short run dynamics are assumed in the construction of the weights, the feasible jackknife estimator still shows significant reduction in bias under certain designs. As is not surprising, parametric maximum likelihood estimation out-performs all semi-parametric methods when the true values of the short memory parameters are known, but is dominated by the semi-parametric methods (in terms of bias) when the short memory parameters need to be estimated, and in particular when the model is misspecified.</p>", "output_year": 2021, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Optimal bias correction of the log-periodogram estimator of the fractional parameter", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Nadarajah, K, Martin, GM & Poskitt, DS 2021, 'Optimal bias correction of the log-periodogram estimator of the fractional parameter: a jackknife approach', Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference, vol. 211, pp. 41-79. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jspi.2020.04.010", "output_keywords": "Cumulants | Log-periodogram regression | Long memory | Bias adjustment | Discrete Fourier transform | Periodograms", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty | Applied Mathematics | Statistics and Probability", "output_id": 315492123, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85088009223", "journal_title": "Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference", "journal_issn_list": "0378-3758", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 1, "output_author_count_internal": 2, "output_author_count_total": 3, "internal_author_list": "Martin, Gael Margaret | Poskitt, Don Stephen", "external_author_list": "Nadarajah, Kanchana", "external_author_org_list": "University of Sheffield", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": 24.669572830200195, "y": -4.672059535980225}, {"output_uuid": "f36eefb5-c0f5-4f7a-aa8e-faa03e95103f", "Abstract": "<p>We examine the relationships between electoral socio-demographic characteristics and two-party preferences in the six Australian federal elections held between 2001 and 2016.

The endangered giant triton snail Charonia tritonis is a natural predator of COTS, although aquarium and field observations indicate the intensity of direct predation may be inadequate to significantly mediate outbreaks. However, their mere presence can elicit a chemically induced sensory behavioural response which may suppress COTS populations when in non-outbreak status. While there is increasing knowledge of the sensory biology of both species, little is known regarding giant triton snail numbers on the GBR or about how they move and occupy space, making it difficult to determine their true zone of influence and thus their capacity to disrupt COTS behaviour. We used passive acoustic telemetry to establish short-term activity space and movement patterns of giant triton snails on the GBR. Individuals were tracked for up to 41 d, were ob-served to travel 234.24 m d-1, with a mean total cumulative distance travelled at night (1923.19 m) nearly double that observed during the day (1014.84 m).

Current OHS analysis ignore important workplace structures and repeated measurements. There is a need to provide systematic analyses of medical data that incorporate the data structure. Although multilevel statistical models may account for features of OHS data, current applications in occupational health medicine are often not appropriate for OHS. Additionally, typical OHS data has not been analysed in a Bayesian framework, which allows for calculation of probabilities of potential events and outcomes. This paper\u2019s objective is to illustrate the use of Bayesian modeling of OHS. Three analytic aims are addressed: (1) Identify patterns and changes in health outcomes; (2) Explore the effects of a particular risk factor, smoking and industrial exposures over time for individuals and worker groups; (3) identify risk of chronic conditions in individuals. Method: A Bayesian hierarchical model was developed to provide individual and group level estimates and inferences for health outcomes, FEV1%, BMI, and Diastolic and Systolic blood pressure. Results: We identified individuals with the greatest degree of change over time for each outcome, and demonstrated how to flag individuals with substantive negative health outcome change. We also assigned probabilities of individuals moving into \u201cat risk\u201d health categories 1 year from their last visit. Conclusion: Bayesian models can account for features typically encountered in OHS data, such as individual repeated measurements and group structures.

We propose a new feasible weighted least squares (WLS) estimator, based on an adaptive estimate of the volatility path of the shocks. We show that this estimator belongs to a generic class of weighted residual sum of squares which also contains the ordinary least squares (OLS) and WLS estimators, the latter based on the true volatility process. For fixed magnitude breaks we show that the consistency rate of the generic estimator is unaffected by non-stationary volatility. We also provide local limiting distribution theory for cases where the break magnitude is either local-to-zero at some polynomial rate in the sample size or is exactly zero. The former includes the Pitman drift rate which is shown via Monte Carlo experiments to predict well the key features of the finite sample behaviour of both the OLS and our feasible WLS estimators. The simulations highlight the importance of the break location, break magnitude, and the form of non-stationary volatility for the finite sample performance of these estimators, and show that our proposed feasible WLS estimator can deliver significant improvements over the OLS estimator under heteroskedasticity. We discuss how these results can be applied, by using level break fraction estimators on the first differences of the data, when testing for a unit root in the presence of trend breaks and/or non-stationary volatility. Methods to select between the break and no break cases, using standard information criteria and feasible weighted information criteria based on our adaptive volatility estimator, are also discussed.

The least squares solution for finding coherent forecasts uses a reconciliation approach known as MinT, proposed by Wickramasuriya, Athanasopoulos, and Hyndman (2019). The MinT approach and its variants do not guarantee that the coherent forecasts are non-negative, even when all of the original forecasts are non-negative in nature. This has become a serious issue in applications that are inherently non-negative such as with sales data or tourism numbers. While overcoming this difficulty, we reconsider the least squares minimization problem with non-negativity constraints to ensure that the coherent forecasts are strictly non-negative. The constrained quadratic programming problem is solved using three algorithms. They are the block principal pivoting (BPV) algorithm, projected conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm, and scaled gradient projection algorithm. A Monte Carlo simulation is performed to evaluate the computational performances of these algorithms as the number of time series increases. The results demonstrate that the BPV algorithm clearly outperforms the rest, and PCG is the second best. The superior performance of the BPV algorithm can be partially attributed to the alternative representation of the weight matrix in the MinT approach. An empirical investigation is carried out to assess the impact of imposing non-negativity constraints on forecast reconciliation over the unconstrained method. It is observed that slight gains in forecast accuracy have occurred at the most disaggregated level. At the aggregated level, slight losses are also observed. Although the gains or losses are negligible, the procedure plays an important role in decision and policy implementation processes.</p>", "output_year": 2020, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Optimal non-negative forecast reconciliation", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Wickramasuriya, SL, Turlach, BA & Hyndman, RJ 2020, 'Optimal non-negative forecast reconciliation', Statistics and Computing, vol. 30, pp. 1167-1182. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11222-020-09930-0", "output_keywords": "Forecast reconciliation | Aggregation | Non-negative | Hierarchical | Coherent forecasts | Least squares", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Computational Theory and Mathematics | Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty | Statistics and Probability | Theoretical Computer Science", "output_id": 303197643, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85083400123", "journal_title": "Statistics and Computing", "journal_issn_list": "0960-3174", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 2, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 3, "internal_author_list": "Hyndman, Robin John", "external_author_list": "Turlach, Berwin A. | Wickramasuriya, Shanika L.", "external_author_org_list": "University of Auckland | University of Western Australia", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": 9, "x": -45.79426193237305, "y": -2.6049721240997314}, {"output_uuid": "78385b74-d61b-4f1c-bf7a-ab5fd7d222ca", "Abstract": "<p>Data from large surveys are often supplemented with sampling weights that are designed to reflect unequal probabilities of response and selection inherent in complex survey sampling methods.

Optimal decision-making requires probabilistic forecasts for demand in a hierarchy with various levels of aggregation, such as substations, cities, and regions. The forecasts should be coherent in the sense that the forecast of the aggregated series should equal the sum of the forecasts of the corresponding disaggregated series. Coherency is essential, since the allocation of electricity at one level of the hierarchy relies on the appropriate amount being provided from the previous level. We introduce a new probabilistic forecasting method for a large hierarchy based on UK residential smart meter data. We find our method provides coherent and accurate probabilistic forecasts, as a result of an effective forecast combination. Furthermore, by avoiding distributional assumptions, we find that our method captures the variety of distributions in the smart meter hierarchy. Finally, the results confirm that, to ensure coherency in our large-scale hierarchy, it is sufficient to model a set of lower-dimension dependencies, rather than modeling the entire joint distribution of all series in the hierarchy. In achieving coherent and accurate hierarchical probabilistic forecasts, this work contributes to improved decision-making for smart grids.

In this regard, the stochastic discretization algorithm of Liu and Liu (2002) is enhanced by updating the discretization procedure for the simulation of the membership function and the calculation formula for the expected values. This is achieved through initiating a novel uniform sampling process and employing a formula for discrete fuzzy numbers, respectively, as the generated membership function in the stochastic discretization algorithm would adversely affect its accuracy to some extent. What is more, considering that the bisection procedure involved in the numerical integration algorithm of Li (2015) is time-consuming and also, not necessary for the specified types of fuzzy numbers, a special numerical integration algorithm is proposed, which can simplify the simulation procedure by adopting the analytical expressions of \u03b1-optimistic values. Subsequently, concerning the extensive applications of regular fuzzy intervals, several theorems are introduced and proved as an extended effort to apply the improved stochastic discretization algorithm and the special numerical integration algorithm to the issues of fuzzy intervals.

The large-scale loss of bees has considerable implications for the agricultural economy because bees are one of the leading pollinators of numerous crops. Bee declines have been associated with several interactive factors. Recent studies suggest nutritional and pathogen stress can interactively contribute to bee physiological declines, but the molecular mechanisms underlying interactive effects remain unknown. In this study, we provide insight into this question by using RNA-sequencing to examine how monofloral diets and Israeli acute paralysis virus inoculation influence gene expression patterns in bees. Results: We found a considerable nutritional response, with almost 2000 transcripts changing with diet quality. The majority of these genes were over-represented for nutrient signaling (insulin resistance) and immune response (Notch signaling and JaK-STAT pathways). In our experimental conditions, the transcriptomic response to viral infection was fairly limited. We only found 43 transcripts to be differentially expressed, some with known immune functions (argonaute-2), transcriptional regulation, and muscle contraction. We created contrasts to explore whether protective mechanisms of good diet were due to direct effects on immune function (resistance) or indirect effects on energy availability (tolerance). A similar number of resistance and tolerance candidate differentially expressed genes were found, suggesting both processes may play significant roles in dietary buffering from pathogen infection. Conclusions: Through transcriptional contrasts and functional enrichment analysis, we contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying feedbacks between nutrition and disease in bees. We also show that comparing results derived from combined analyses across multiple RNA-seq studies may allow researchers to identify transcriptomic patterns in bees that are concurrently less artificial and less noisy. This work underlines the merits of using data visualization techniques and multiple datasets to interpret RNA-sequencing studies.</p>", "output_year": 2019, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Transcriptomic responses to diet quality and viral infection in Apis mellifera", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Rutter, L, Carrillo-Tripp, J, Bonning, BC, Cook, D, Toth, AL & Dolezal, AG 2019, 'Transcriptomic responses to diet quality and viral infection in Apis mellifera', BMC Genomics, vol. 20, 412. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-019-5767-1", "output_keywords": "Honey bee | Israeli acute paralysis virus | Monofloral pollen | RNA-sequencing | Visualization", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Biotechnology | Genetics", "output_id": 298957533, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85066503653", "journal_title": "BMC Genomics", "journal_issn_list": "1471-2164", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 5, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 6, "internal_author_list": "Cook, Dianne Helen", "external_author_list": "Bonning, Bryony C. | Carrillo-Tripp, Jimena | Dolezal, Adam G. | Rutter, Lindsay | Toth, Amy L", "external_author_org_list": "Centro de Investigacion Cientifica y de Educaci\u00f3n Superior de Ensenada CICESE (Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education at Ensenada) | Iowa State University | University of Florida | University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": 12.479565620422363, "y": -20.710731506347656}, {"output_uuid": "8544d079-03d0-4d31-a800-07562f169732", "Abstract": "<p>This paper introduces ggenealogy (Rutter, Vanderplas, and Cook 2019), a developing R software package that provides tools for searching through genealogical data, generating basic statistics on their graphical structures using parent and child connections, parsing and performing calculations on branches of interest, and displaying the results.

A number of reasons stand for this\u2014first, complex data such as a MET give rise to distinct levels of residuals (eg, at a trial level or individual observation level). This complexity offers additional challenges for an outlier detection method. Second, many linear mixed model software packages that cater for complex variance structures needed in the analysis of MET are not well streamlined for diagnostics by practitioners. We demonstrate outlier detection methods that are simple to implement in any linear mixed model software packages and computationally fast. Although these methods are not optimal methods in outlier detection, they offer practical value for ease of application in the analysis pipeline of regularly collected data. These are demonstrated using simulation based on two real bread wheat yield METs.

Even though the data collection is considered high-throughput, data analysis has intricacies that require careful human attention. Researchers should use modern data analysis techniques that incorporate visual feedback to verify the appropriateness of their models. While some RNA-seq packages provide static visualization tools, their capabilities should be expanded and their meaningfulness should be explicitly demonstrated to users. Results: In this paper, we 1) introduce new interactive RNA-seq visualization tools, 2) compile a collection of examples that demonstrate to biologists why visualization should be an integral component of differential expression analysis. We use public RNA-seq datasets to show that our new visualization tools can detect normalization issues, differential expression designation problems, and common analysis errors. We also show that our new visualization tools can identify genes of interest in ways undetectable with models. Our R package \"bigPint\" includes the plotting tools introduced in this paper, many of which are unique additions to what is currently available. The \"bigPint\" website is located at https://lindsayrutter.github.io/bigPint and contains short vignette articles that introduce new users to our package, all written in reproducible code. Conclusions: We emphasize that interactive graphics should be an indispensable component of modern RNA-seq analysis, which is currently not the case. This paper and its corresponding software aim to persuade 1) users to slightly modify their differential expression analyses by incorporating statistical graphics into their usual analysis pipelines, 2) developers to create additional complex and interactive plotting methods for RNA-seq data, possibly using lessons learned from our open-source codes. We hope our work will serve a small part in upgrading the RNA-seq analysis world into one that more wholistically extracts biological information using both models and visuals.</p>", "output_year": 2019, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Visualization methods for differential expression analysis", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Rutter, L, Moran Lauter, AN, Graham, MA & Cook, D 2019, 'Visualization methods for differential expression analysis', BMC Bioinformatics, vol. 20, 458. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-019-2968-1", "output_keywords": "Statistical graphics | Interactive | RNA-sequencing | Visualization", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Biochemistry | Molecular Biology | Structural Biology | Computer Science Applications | Applied Mathematics", "output_id": 295199616, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85071896357", "journal_title": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal_issn_list": "1471-2105", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 3, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 4, "internal_author_list": "Cook, Dianne Helen", "external_author_list": "Graham, Michelle A. | Moran Lauter, Adrienne N. | Rutter, Lindsay", "external_author_org_list": "Iowa State University | United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": 19.17972183227539, "y": -20.631319046020508}, {"output_uuid": "ec1cf3fd-2d23-42b3-bed3-22bfe6302238", "Abstract": "<p>Good segmentation contributes towards a better understanding of the market and customer demands.

When fitting such models, two of the major challenges are selecting the order, that is, the number of factors, and an appropriate structure for the loading matrix, typically a sparse structure. Motivated by the application of GLLVMs to study marine species assemblages in the Southern Ocean, we propose the Ordered Factor LASSO or OFAL penalty for order selection and achieving sparsity in GLLVMs. The OFAL penalty is the first penalty developed specifically for order selection in latent variable models, and achieves this by using a hierarchically structured group LASSO type penalty to shrink entire columns of the loading matrix to zero, while ensuring that non-zero loadings are concentrated on the lower-order factors. Simultaneously, individual element sparsity is achieved through the use of an adaptive LASSO. In conjunction with using an information criterion which promotes aggressive shrinkage, simulation shows that the OFAL penalty performs strongly compared with standard methods and penalties for order selection, achieving sparsity, and prediction in GLLVMs. Applying the OFAL penalty to the Southern Ocean marine species dataset suggests the available environmental predictors explain roughly half of the total covariation between species, thus leading to a smaller number of latent variables and increased sparsity in the loading matrix compared to a model without any covariates.</p>", "output_year": 2018, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Order selection and sparsity in latent variable models via the ordered factor LASSO", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Hui, FKC, Tanaka, E & Warton, DI 2018, 'Order selection and sparsity in latent variable models via the ordered factor LASSO', Biometrics, vol. 74, no. 4, pp. 1311-1319. https://doi.org/10.1111/biom.12888", "output_keywords": "Factor analysis | LASSO | Regularization | Penalized likelihood | Dimension reduction | Generalized linear latent variable models | Loadings", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Agricultural and Biological Sciences(all) | Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology(all) | Immunology and Microbiology(all) | Applied Mathematics | Statistics and Probability", "output_id": 294461151, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85060980653", "journal_title": "Biometrics", "journal_issn_list": "0006-341X", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 2, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 3, "internal_author_list": "Tanaka, Emi", "external_author_list": "Hui, Francis K.C. | Warton, David I.", "external_author_org_list": "Australian National University (ANU) | University of New South Wales (UNSW) | University of Sydney", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": 38.9234733581543, "y": 18.73491096496582}, {"output_uuid": "c6b444cd-a86b-43f2-a114-f02b41f209fd", "Abstract": "<p>The mitigation of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions requires a global effort with common but differentiated responsibilities.

Bacterial assemblages are typically highly diverse in juveniles and are speculated to exert roles critical to coral ontogenetic development. However, knowledge about bacterial dynamics in coral recruits is scarce, especially in brooders. In this study, we investigated the temporal dynamics of bacterial communities associated with Pocillopora acuta early recruits exposed to different microbial environments. One week after settlement, recruits were grown in a flow-through system with 0.4\u00a0\u00b5m filtered seawater either alone, or in the vicinity of adult Pocillopora acuta or Platygyra daedalea coral fragments, which associate with different microbiomes. After 5\u00a0weeks, all corals were transferred to a mesocosm containing various marine organisms, where they were reared for another 4\u00a0weeks. In addition to observing the development of coral-associated microbial communities, we assessed whether exposing Pocillopora acuta recruits to different adult coral species influenced their bacterial communities. Our motivation was to examine whether this approach can be used to modify bacteria and Symbiodiniaceae associated with these early life stages. While adult Pocillopora acuta fragments had bacterial assemblages dominated by Endozoicomonadaceae, bacterial communities of Platygyra daedalea fragments were dominated by Flammeovirgaceae and Rhodospirillaceae. Bacterial communities associated with recruits were more diverse than those found in adults and contained larger relative abundances of Flavobacteriaceae, Rhodobacteraceae and Erythrobacteraceae. All recruits harbored the same Symbiodiniaceae type throughout the experiment (dominated by Cladocopium C1d sequences), and their bacterial communities did not differ across treatments. Instead, there was a significant change over time characterized by a decline in the relative abundance of Flavobacteriaceae and an increase in the abundance of Endozoicomonadaceae. Our findings indicate that Pocillopora acuta recruits harbor dynamic and diverse bacterial assemblages, which were not influenced by nearby adult corals in our experimental design.</p>", "output_year": 2020, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Bacterial and algal symbiont dynamics in early recruits exposed to two adult coral species", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Damjanovic, K, Blackall, LL, Men\u00e9ndez, P & van Oppen, MJH 2020, 'Bacterial and algal symbiont dynamics in early recruits exposed to two adult coral species', Coral Reefs, vol. 39, pp. 189-202. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00338-019-01871-z", "output_keywords": "Coral recruits | Bacterial transmission | Pocillopora acuta | Microbial dynamics | Platygyra daedalea", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Aquatic Science", "output_id": 294139615, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85075121384", "journal_title": "Coral Reefs", "journal_issn_list": "0722-4028", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 3, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 4, "internal_author_list": "Menendez Galvan, Patricia", "external_author_list": "Blackall, Linda L. | Damjanovic, Katarina | van Oppen, Madeleine J.

Extending earlier work on nonstationary kernel regression to take account of practical features of the data, we allow the regressors to be cointegrated and to embody a mixture of stochastic and deterministic trends, complications which result in asymptotic degeneracy of the kernel-weighted signal matrix. To address these complications new local and global rotation techniques are introduced to transform the covariate space to accommodate multiple scenarios of induced degeneracy. Under regularity conditions we derive asymptotic results that differ substantially from existing kernel regression asymptotics, leading to new limit theory under multiple convergence rates. For the practically important case of endogenous nonstationary regressors we propose a fully-modified kernel estimator whose limit distribution theory corresponds to the prototypical pure cointegration case (i.e., with exogenous covariates), thereby facilitating inference using a generalized Wald-type test statistic. These results substantially generalize econometric estimation and testing techniques in the cointegration literature to accommodate time variation and complications of co-moving regressors.

However, relatively scant research has been carried out so far in relation to insurance. This paper proposes a stochastic, nonlinear time-varying premium-reserve (P-R) system with Lipschitz-type conditions in discrete-time to explore P-R system's stability, stabilization and H<sub>\u221e</sub>-control properties.

Evidence of an association between hospital surgery volume and LOS has been mixed. Data modelling techniques may give inconsistent results that adversely impact conclusions. This study applied techniques to overcome possible modelling drawbacks. Method: An additive quantile regression model formulated to isolate hospital contextual effects was applied to every colorectal surgery for cancer conducted in Victoria, Australia, between 2005 and 2015, involving 28,343 admissions in 90 Victorian hospitals. The model compared hospitals\u2019 operational efficiencies regarding LOS. Results: Hospital LOS operational efficiencies for colorectal cancer surgery varied markedly between the 90 hospitals and were independent of volume. This result was adjusted for pertinent patient and hospital characteristics. Conclusion: No evidence was found that higher annual surgery volume was associated with lower LOS for patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery. Our model showed strong evidence that differences in LOS efficiency between hospitals was driven by hospital contextual effects that were not predicted by provider volume. Further study is required to elucidate these inherent differences between hospitals.

However, it is particularly challenging to forecast these hierarchical structures. In fact, it requires not only good forecast accuracy at each level of the hierarchy, but also the coherency between dierent levels, i.e. the forecasts should satisfy the hierarchical aggregation constraints. Given some incoherent base forecasts, the state-of-the-art methods compute revised forecasts based on forecast combination which ensures that the aggregation constraints are satised. However, these methods assume the base forecasts are unbiased and constrain the revised forecasts to be also unbiased. We propose a new forecasting method which relaxes these unbiasedness conditions, and seeks the revised forecasts with the best tradeo between bias and forecast variance. We also present a regularization method which allows us to deal with high-dimensional hierarchies, and provide its theoretical justication. Finally, we compare the proposed method with the state-of-the-art methods both theoretically and empirically.

However, the physical and economic constraints of manual sampling prohibit data collection at the frequency required to adequately capture the variation in concentrations through time. Here, we developed models to predict total suspended solids (TSS) and oxidized nitrogen (NOx) concentrations based on high-frequency time series of turbidity, conductivity and river level data from in situ sensors in rivers flowing into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. We fit generalized-linear mixed-effects models with continuous first-order autoregressive correlation structures to water-quality data collected by manual sampling at two freshwater sites and one estuarine site and used the fitted models to predict TSS and NOx from the in situ sensor data. These models described the temporal autocorrelation in the data and handled observations collected at irregular frequencies, characteristics typical of water-quality monitoring data. Turbidity proved a useful and generalizable surrogate of TSS, with high predictive ability in the estuarine and fresh water sites. Turbidity, conductivity and river level served as combined surrogates of NOx. However, the relationship between NOx and the covariates was more complex than that between TSS and turbidity, and consequently the ability to predict NOx was lower and less generalizable across sites than for TSS. Furthermore, prediction intervals tended to increase during events, for both TSS and NOx models, highlighting the need to include measures of uncertainty routinely in water-quality reporting. Our study also highlights that surrogate-based models used to predict sediments and nutrients need to better incorporate temporal components if variance estimates are to be unbiased and model inference meaningful. The transferability of models across sites, and potentially regions, will become increasingly important as organizations move to automated sensing for water-quality monitoring throughout catchments.</p>", "output_year": 2019, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Predicting sediment and nutrient concentrations from high-frequency water-quality data", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Leigh, C, Kandanaarachchi, S, McGree, JM, Hyndman, RJ, Alsibai, O, Mengersen, K & Peterson, EE 2019, 'Predicting sediment and nutrient concentrations from high-frequency water-quality data', PLoS ONE, vol. 14, no. 8, e0215503. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215503", "output_keywords": null, "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Agricultural and Biological Sciences(all) | Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology(all)", "output_id": 283961877, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85071426624", "journal_title": "PLoS ONE", "journal_issn_list": "1932-6203", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 5, "output_author_count_internal": 2, "output_author_count_total": 7, "internal_author_list": "Hyndman, Robin John | Kandanaarachchi, Sevvandi Priyanvada", "external_author_list": "Alsibai, Omar | Leigh, Catherine | McGree, James M. | Mengersen, Kerrie Lee | Peterson, Erin E.", "external_author_org_list": "Queensland University of Technology (QUT)", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": -19.025184631347656, "y": -7.125006198883057}, {"output_uuid": "603fa4fb-ea44-458a-8ef7-8cd5d96dd3ca", "Abstract": "We consider how to estimate the trend and cycle of a time series, such as real GDP, given a large information set.

This approach models access as a supply-to-demand ratio for each area, targeting areas with high demand and low supply for AED placement. These methods incorporate spatial covariates on OHCA occurrence, but do not provide precise AED locations, which are critical to the initial intent of such location analysis research. Exact AED locations can be determined using optimisation methods, but they do not incorporate known spatial risk factors for OHCA, such as income and demographics. Combining these two approaches would evaluate AED placement impact, describe drivers of OHCA occurrence, and identify areas that may not be appropriately covered by AED placement strategies. There are two aims in this paper. First, to develop geospatial models of OHCA that account for and display uncertainty. Second, to evaluate the AED placement methods using geospatial models of accessibility. We first identify communities with the greatest gap between demand and supply for allocating AEDs. We then use this information to evaluate models for precise AED location deployment. Methods Case study data set consisted of 2802 OHCA events and 719 AEDs. Spatial OHCA occurrence was described using a geospatial model, with possible spatial correlation accommodated by introducing a conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior on the municipality-level spatial random effect. This model was fit with Integrated Nested Laplacian Approximation (INLA), using covariates for population density, proportion male, proportion over 65 years, financial strength, and the proportion of land used for transport, commercial, buildings, recreation, and urban areas. Optimisation methods for AED locations were applied to find the top 100 AED placement locations. AED access was calculated for current access and 100 AED placements. Priority rankings were then given for each area based on their access score and predicted number of OHCA events. Results Of the 2802 OHCA events, 64.28% occurred in rural areas, and 35.72% in urban areas. Additionally, over 70% of individuals were aged over 65. Supply of AEDs was less than demand in most areas. Priority regions for AED placement were identified, and access scores were evaluated for AED placement methodology by ranking the access scores and the predicted OHCA count. AED placement methodology placed AEDs in areas with the highest priority, but placed more AEDs in areas with more predicted OHCA events in each grid cell. Conclusion The methods in this paper incorporate OHCA spatial risk factors and OHCA coverage to identify spatial regions most in need of resources. These methods can be used to help understand how AED allocation methods affect OHCA accessibility, which is of significant practical value for communities when deciding AED placements.</p>", "output_year": 2019, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Evaluating health facility access using Bayesian spatial models and location analysis methods", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Tierney, NJ, Mira, A, Jost Reinhold, H, Arbia, G, Clifford, S, Auricchio, A, Moccetti, T, Peluso, S & Mengersen, KL 2019, 'Evaluating health facility access using Bayesian spatial models and location analysis methods', PLoS ONE, vol. 14, no. 8, e0218310. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0218310", "output_keywords": null, "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Agricultural and Biological Sciences(all) | Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology(all)", "output_id": 281910505, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85070253048", "journal_title": "PLoS ONE", "journal_issn_list": "1932-6203", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 8, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 9, "internal_author_list": "Tierney, Nicholas John", "external_author_list": "Arbia, Giuseppe | Auricchio, Angelo | Clifford, Samuel | Jost Reinhold, H. | Mengersen, Kerrie Lee | Mira, Antonietta | Moccetti, Tiziano | Peluso, Stefano", "external_author_org_list": "Fondazione Cardiocentro Ticino (Cardiocentro Ticino Foundation) | Fondazione Ticino Cuore (Ticino Cuore Foundation) | London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine | Queensland University of Technology (QUT) | Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (Catholic University of the Sacred Heart) | Universita della Svizzera Italiana (University of Lugano) | Universit\u00e0 degli Studi dell'Insubria (University of Insubria)", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": 31.39472770690918, "y": -13.244537353515625}, {"output_uuid": "78b78529-a6ae-459f-a4dd-7740665cd1c4", "Abstract": "<p>Using data from one of Australia's largest thoroughbred auction houses, we investigate the price determinants of thoroughbred yearlings sold at auction.

Under stressful conditions, disruption of the coral prokaryotic microbiome is linked to increased susceptibility to diseases and mortality. Inoculation of corals with beneficial microbes could confer enhanced stress tolerance to the host and may be a powerful tool to help corals thrive under challenging environmental conditions. Here, we explored the feasibility of coral early life stage microbiome manipulation by repeatedly inoculating coral recruits with a bacterial cocktail generated in the laboratory. Co-culturing the two species Acropora tenuis and Platygyra daedalea allowed us to simultaneously investigate the effect of host factors on the coral microbiome. Inoculation cocktails were regularly prepared from freshly grown pure bacterial cultures, which were hence assumed viable, and characterized via the optical density measurement of each individual strain put in suspension. Coral early recruits were inoculated seven times over 3 weeks and sampled once 36 h following the last inoculation event. At this time point, the cumulative inoculations with the bacterial cocktails had a strong effect on the bacterial community composition in recruits of both coral species. While the location of bacterial cells within the coral hosts was not assessed, metabarcoding using the 16S rRNA gene revealed that two and six of the seven bacterial strains administered through the cocktails were significantly enriched in inoculated recruits of A. tenuis and P. daedalea, respectively, compared to control recruits. Despite being reared in the same environment, A. tenuis and P. daedalea established significantly different bacterial communities, both in terms of taxonomic composition and diversity measurements. These findings indicate that coral host factors as well as the environmental bacterial pool play a role in shaping coral-associated bacterial community composition. Host factors may include microbe transmission mode (horizontal versus maternal) and host specificity.

To understand the mechanisms underlying the recovery process of coral communities, colony abundance and size distribution were followed on reefs around Pelorus Island, located in the inshore central region of the Great Barrier Reef, following a severe tropical cyclone in 2011 that caused dramatic loss of coral communities. Permanent quadrats (600\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>) were monitored biannually between 2012 and 2016, and individual coral colonies were counted, sized and categorized into morphological types. The abundance of coral recruits and coral cover were also examined using permanent quadrats and random line intercept transects, respectively. The number of colonies in the smallest size class (4\u201310\u00a0cm) increased substantially during the study period, driving the recovery of coral populations. The total number of coral colonies 5\u00a0yr post-cyclone reached between 73 and 122% of pre-cyclone levels though coral cover remained between 16 and 31% of pre-cyclone levels, due to the dominance of small coral colonies in the recovering communities. Temporal transitions of coral demography (i.e., colony-size distributions) illustrated that the number of recently established coral populations overtook communities of surviving colonies. Coral recruits (<\u00a04\u00a0cm in size) also showed increasing patterns in abundance over the study period, underscoring the importance of larval supply in coral recovery.

This study examines whether amphetamine-related admissions to mental health units are more common at times of greater amphetamine availability. Methods: We conducted an ecological study using aggregate crime and health service data for NSW, Australia, from January 2000 to March 2015. Amphetamine-related criminal incidents (arrests or cautions for possession or use) were used as an indirect measure of amphetamine availability. Semiparametric time series analysis was used to compare monthly arrest rates to monthly hospitalisation rates for (1) amphetamine abuse or dependence, (2) amphetamine-related psychosis and (3) any psychosis. Results: Amphetamine-related admissions to NSW mental health units have increased four- to fivefold since 2009 and comprised approximately 10% of all admissions to these units in early 2015. There was a significant association between arrests and amphetamine-related admissions. After adjustment for seasonal variation, this effect demonstrated a time lag of 1\u20132 months. There was no relationship between amphetamine arrests and overall admissions for psychosis. Conclusion: Greater amphetamine availability significantly predicts admissions for amphetamine use disorders and amphetamine-related psychosis.

This information is currently limited for the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and is necessary for understanding the impacts of disturbances and the system's potential for recovery. This study reports juvenile and adult hard coral abundance and composition from 122 reefs on the GBR during a period of limited acute disturbance. The data represent baseline observations for juvenile hard coral assemblages spanning the longitudinal cross-shelf gradient of the GBR and 12 degrees of latitude and augment reported distribution of adult coral assemblages over the same scale with inclusion of additional reefs. Juvenile and adult coral assemblages reflected broad differences imposed by the gradient of environmental conditions across the GBR. The mean density of juvenile hard corals was lower in the inshore reefs (5.51 m<sup>2</sup>) than at either the mid-shelf (11.8 m<sup>2</sup>) or outer shelf reefs (11.2 m<sup>2</sup>). The composition of juvenile and adult coral assemblages covaried overall, although there were different relationships between these two life stages across the continental shelf and among community types. Dissimilarity between juvenile and adult coral assemblages was greater on inshore and outer shelf reefs than on reefs in the mid-shelf, although, there were differences in community types both within these shelf positions and those that spanned mid- and outer shelf reefs. Dissimilarity was greatest for Inshore branching Acropora and high for Southern Acropora communities, although very high coral cover and very low juvenile densities at these reefs precluded interpretation beyond the clear competitive dominance of Acropora on those reefs. Dissimilarity was also high between juvenile and adult coral assemblages of Turbid inshore communities suggesting water quality pressures, along with synergistic effects of other stressors, pose ongoing selective pressures beyond the juvenile stage. Conversely, relatively low dissimilarity between juvenile and adult coral assemblages on mid-shelf and lower latitude outer shelf reefs suggests pressures beyond those influencing settlement and early post-settlement survival were having less influence on the composition of adult coral assemblages.</p>", "output_year": 2019, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Cross-shelf variation among juvenile and adult coral assemblages on Australia's Great Barrier Reef", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Jonker, MJ, Thompson, AA, Men\u00e9ndez, P & Osborne, K 2019, 'Cross-shelf variation among juvenile and adult coral assemblages on Australia's Great Barrier Reef', Diversity, vol. 11, no. 6, 85. https://doi.org/10.3390/d11060085", "output_keywords": "Cross-shelf gradient | Coral reef | Assemblage structure | Inshore vs offshore | Scleractinian | Juvenile coral | Benthic assemblages | Community composition | Habitat structure", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous) | Ecological Modelling | Ecology | Nature and Landscape Conservation", "output_id": 278213242, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85067260240", "journal_title": "Diversity", "journal_issn_list": "1424-2818", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 3, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 4, "internal_author_list": "Menendez Galvan, Patricia", "external_author_list": "Jonker, Michelle J. | Osborne, Kate | Thompson, Angus A.", "external_author_org_list": "Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS)  | University of Queensland ", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": -28.434528350830078, "y": 2.121809482574463}, {"output_uuid": "98e3a3b8-7a7e-4fea-874c-3d45617ba675", "Abstract": "Major infrastructure projects are the delivery vehicle for the development, expansion and extension or retirement/demolition of Governmental investment that is intent in place making. Whilst a successful engine for change, major projects have been under scrutiny for their poor success record.

In addition, emerging challenges that require a new set of skills and competencies are also at the forefront of cannibalising a conventional understanding of what managing major projects entails and how to enable successful project delivery.<br/>From the literature review, we have been able to identify current key challenges and emerging challenges faced in the delivery of major projects. Our literature suggests that emerging challenges relate to technological, sustainability and acceleration of delivery in this increasingly complex context of project delivery. We propose a model for further examination to identify to what extent existing skills and competencies have been adopted, or replaced through newly acquired skills; and whether emerging challenges can be adequately<br/>addressed, and whether current challenges require new skills and competencies due to the evolving nature of these challenges. The model also examines the behavioural factors that impact on the acquisition and development of new skills and competencies.<br/>This paper contributes to the growing literature on examining the development and effectiveness of project managers\u2019 skills and competencies in managing major infrastructure projects in the construction industry.

The statistical analysis becomes challenging when the regression function is discontinuous and the distribution of measurement error is unknown. In the literature, most existing jump regression methods either assume that there is no measurement error involved or require that jumps are explicitly detected before the regression function can be estimated. In some applications, however, the ultimate goal is to estimate the regression function and to preserve the jumps in the process of estimation. In this paper, we are concerned with reconstructing jump regression curve from data that involve measurement error. We propose a direct jump-preserving method that does not explicitly detect jumps. The challenge of restoring jump structure masked by measurement error is handled by local clustering. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed curve estimator is statistically consistent. A numerical comparison with an existing jump regression method highlights its jump-preserving property. Finally, we demonstrate our method by an application to a health tax policy study in Australia.</p>", "output_year": 2019, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Errors-in-variables jump regression using local clustering", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Kang, Y, Gong, X, Gao, J & Qiu, P 2019, 'Errors-in-variables jump regression using local clustering', Statistics in Medicine, vol. 38, no. 19, pp. 3642-3655. https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8205", "output_keywords": "local regression | health care | kernel smoothing | price elasticity | clustering | measurement errors | discontinuities", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Statistics and Probability | Epidemiology", "output_id": 276985304, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85066911005", "journal_title": "Statistics in Medicine", "journal_issn_list": "0277-6715", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 3, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 4, "internal_author_list": "Gao, Jiti", "external_author_list": "Gong, Xiaodong | Kang, Yicheng | Qiu, Peihua", "external_author_org_list": "Bentley University | University of Canberra | University of Florida", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": 2, "x": 20.611738204956055, "y": -7.555586814880371}, {"output_uuid": "1349ecf7-4048-4e17-9804-39b1b95f6b6c", "Abstract": "<p>Bioconductor is a widely used R-based platform for genomics, but its host of complex genomic data structures places a cognitive burden on the user.

Mortality modeling and forecasting have therefore attracted increasing attention from various areas, such as the public pension systems, commercial insurance sectors, as well as actuarial, demographic and epidemiological research. Compared to the aggregate mortality experience, cause-specific mortality rates contain more detailed information, and can help us better understand the ongoing mortality improvements. However, when conducting cause-of-death mortality modeling, it is important to ensure coherence in the forecasts. That is, the forecasts of cause-specific mortality rates should add up to the forecasts of the aggregate mortality rates. In this paper, we propose a novel forecast reconciliation approach to achieve this goal. We use the age-specific mortality experience in the U.S. during 1970\u20132015 as a case study. Seven major causes of death are considered in this paper. By incorporating both the disaggregate cause-specific data and the aggregate total-level data, we achieve better forecasting results at both levels and coherence across forecasts. Moreover, we perform a cluster analysis on the cause-specific mortality data. It is shown that combining mortality experience from causes with similar mortality patterns can provide additional useful information, and thus further improve forecast accuracy. Finally, based on the proposed reconciliation approach, we conduct a scenario-based analysis to project future mortality rates under the assumption of certain causes being eliminated.</p>", "output_year": 2019, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "A forecast reconciliation approach to cause-of-death mortality modeling", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Li, H, Li, H, Lu, Y & Panagiotelis, A 2019, 'A forecast reconciliation approach to cause-of-death mortality modeling', Insurance: Mathematics and Economics, vol. 86, pp. 122-133. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.insmatheco.2019.02.011", "output_keywords": "Forecast reconciliation | Cause-of-death | Cause-elimination | Hierarchical time series | Clustering | Mortality modeling", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty | Economics and Econometrics | Statistics and Probability", "output_id": 270015796, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85062861782", "journal_title": "Insurance: Mathematics and Economics", "journal_issn_list": "0167-6687", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 3, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 4, "internal_author_list": "Panagiotelis, Anastasios Nicholas", "external_author_list": "Li, Han | Li, Hong | Lu, Yang", "external_author_org_list": "H\u00f4pitaux Universitaires Paris Nord Val de Seine (Paris Nord Val de Seine University Hospitals) | Macquarie University | University of Manitoba", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": 16, "x": -5.460577487945557, "y": 12.44404125213623}, {"output_uuid": "896cc0a3-9fe3-47ab-9be8-9bcefe0a9db4", "Abstract": "<p>In the present paper, a two-stage fuzzy facility location problem under the Value-at-Risk (VaR) criterion is considered for controlling the risk in location decisions.

Nevertheless, for complex systems, such as multi-body structures, an explicit formulation of the equations of motion by utilizing generalized, independent, coordinates can be a daunting task. In this regard, employing a set of redundant coordinates can facilitate the formulation of the governing dynamics equations. In this setting, however, standard response analysis techniques cannot be applied in a straightforward manner. For instance, defining and determining a transfer function within a frequency domain response analysis framework is challenging due to the presence of singular matrices, and thus, the machinery of generalized matrix inverses needs to be employed. An efficient frequency domain response analysis methodology for structural dynamical systems modeled via dependent coordinates is developed herein.

However, the data are confounded by anomalies caused by technical issues, for which the volume and velocity of data preclude manual detection. We present a framework for automated anomaly detection in high-frequency water-quality data from in situ sensors, using turbidity, conductivity and river level data collected from rivers flowing into the Great Barrier Reef. After identifying end-user needs and defining anomalies, we ranked anomaly importance and selected suitable detection methods. High priority anomalies included sudden isolated spikes and level shifts, most of which were classified correctly by regression-based methods such as autoregressive integrated moving average models. However, incorporation of multiple water-quality variables as covariates reduced performance due to complex relationships among variables. Classifications of drift and periods of anomalously low or high variability were more often correct when we applied mitigation, which replaces anomalous measurements with forecasts for further forecasting, but this inflated false positive rates. Feature-based methods also performed well on high priority anomalies and were similarly less proficient at detecting lower priority anomalies, resulting in high false negative rates. Unlike regression-based methods, however, all feature-based methods produced low false positive rates and have the benefit of not requiring training or optimization. Rule-based methods successfully detected a subset of lower priority anomalies, specifically impossible values and missing observations. We therefore suggest that a combination of methods will provide optimal performance in terms of correct anomaly detection, whilst minimizing false detection rates. Furthermore, our framework emphasizes the importance of communication between end-users and anomaly detection developers for optimal outcomes with respect to both detection performance and end-user application. To this end, our framework has high transferability to other types of high frequency time-series data and anomaly detection applications.</p>", "output_year": 2019, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "A framework for automated anomaly detection in high frequency water-quality data from in situ sensors", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Leigh, C, Alsibai, O, Hyndman, RJ, Kandanaarachchi, S, King, OC, McGree, JM, Neelamraju, C, Strauss, J, Talagala, PD & Turner, RDR et al. 2019, 'A framework for automated anomaly detection in high frequency water-quality data from in situ sensors', Science of the Total Environment, vol. 664, pp. 885-898. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.085", "output_keywords": "Forecasting | Big data | Time series | River | Near-real time | Quality control and assurance", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Environmental Chemistry | Environmental Engineering | Pollution | Waste Management and Disposal", "output_id": 261700480, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85061392804", "journal_title": "Science of the Total Environment", "journal_issn_list": "0048-9697", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 9, "output_author_count_internal": 3, "output_author_count_total": 12, "internal_author_list": "Hyndman, Robin John | Kandanaarachchi, Sevvandi Priyanvada | Talagala, Priyanga Dilini", "external_author_list": "Alsibai, Omar | King, Olivia C. | Leigh, Catherine | McGree, James M. | Mengersen, Kerrie Lee | Neelamraju, Catherine | Peterson, Erin E. | Strauss, Jennifer | Turner, Ryan D.R.", "external_author_org_list": "Department of Environment and Science (Queensland)  | Queensland University of Technology (QUT)", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": -31.104595184326172, "y": -2.2773520946502686}, {"output_uuid": "afe86972-cd93-4a70-94e5-ab6f05682529", "Abstract": "<p>We study the preventive maintenance scheduling problem of wind farms in the offshore wind energy sector which operates under uncertainty due to the state of the ocean and market demand.

An improved procedure to determine the autocorrelation function of ITS is proposed, which also serves as a basis for clustering. The different alternative approaches are explored and their performances compared for ITS simulated under different setups.

Because the model and parameter uncertainties play key roles for actuaries, decision makers, and policymakers, the implementation of advanced mathematical and statistical techniques is highly required. Over the last two decades, applications of regime switching models to finance and economics have received strong attention among researchers and particularly among market practitioners. This paper attempts to consider how a linear arbitrary regime switching system in discrete-time framework could be applied to calculate the medium- and long- term reserves and the relevant premiums (abbreviated here as the P-R process) from the point of view of an insurer. In this direction, some recently developed techniques from linear robust control theory are applied to explore the stability, stabilization, and robust H\u221e-control of a P-R system and the potential effects of abrupt structural changes in the economic fundamentals, as well as the insurer's strategy over a finite time period. Sufficient linear matrix inequality conditions are derived for this treatment.

Thus the pricing of financial, pension and insurance products that are contingent upon survival or death and which is related to the accuracy of central mortality rates is of key importance. Recently, a temperature-related mortality (TRM) model was proposed by Seklecka et al.\u00a0(Journal of Forecasting, 2017, 36(7), 824\u2013841), and it has shown evidence of outperformance compared with the Lee and Carter (Journal of the American Statistical Association, 1992, 87, 659\u2013671) model and several others of its extensions, when mortality-experience data from the UK are used. There is a need for awareness, when fitting the TRM model, of model risk when assessing longevity-related liabilities, especially when pricing long-term annuities and pensions. In this paper, the impact of uncertainty on the various parameters involved in the model is examined. We demonstrate a number of ways to quantify model risk in the estimation of the temperature-related parameters, the choice of the forecasting methodology, the structures of actuarial products chosen (e.g., annuity, endowment and life insurance), and the actuarial reserve.

This problem arises from the fact that the longevity market is illiquid and is considered to be incomplete. In this paper we provide an insight to the study of several pricing approaches for longevity instruments that have been proposed in the literature. To account for parameter uncertainty in mortality forecasts and longevity instruments pricing, our analysis hinges on a Bayesian state-space mortality model.

Under real-world conditions, the system lifetime can be modeled as a fuzzy interval due to parameter uncertainty and data inaccuracy. In this paper, several fuzzy standby redundancy optimization models are proposed utilizing three distinct types of decision criteria, namely as the expected value model, the chance-constrained and the dependent-chance programming. Thereafter, two solution processes are proposed. The first one utilizes a novel algorithm with lower computational complexity for a specific fuzzy objective which is embedded into intelligent optimization algorithms to derive a hybrid algorithm.

However, these fixed location models cannot relocate existing AEDs in a flexible way, and have nearly exclusively been applied to urban regions. We developed a flexible location model for AEDs, compared its performance to existing fixed location and population models, and explored how these perform across urban and rural regions. Methods: Optimisation techniques were applied to AED deployment and OHCA coverage was assessed. A total of 2802 geolocated OHCAs occurred in Canton Ticino, Switzerland, from January 1st 2005 to December 31st 2015. Results: There were 719 AEDs in Canton Ticino. 635 (23%) OHCA events occurred within 100 m of an AED, with 306 (31%) in urban, and 329 (18%) in rural areas. Median distance from OHCA events to the nearest AED was 224 m (168 m urban vs. 269 m rural). Flexible location models performed better than fixed location and population models, with the cost to deploy 20 new AEDs instead relocating 171 existing AEDs to new locations, improving OHCA coverage to 38%, compared to 26% using fixed models, and 24% with the population based model. Conclusions: Optimisation models for AEDs placement are superior to population models and should be strongly considered by communities when selecting areas for AED deployment. Compared to other models, flexible location models increase overall OHCA coverage, and decreases the distance to nearby AEDs, even in rural areas, while saving significant financial resources.</p>", "output_year": 2018, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Novel relocation methods for automatic external defibrillator improve out-of-hospital cardiac arrest coverage under limited resources", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Tierney, NJ, Reinhold, HJ, Mira, A, Weiser, M, Burkart, R, Benvenuti, C & Auricchio, A 2018, 'Novel relocation methods for automatic external defibrillator improve out-of-hospital cardiac arrest coverage under limited resources', Resuscitation, vol. 125, pp. 83-89. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2018.01.055", "output_keywords": "Cardiopulmonary resuscitation | Automated external defibrillation | Defibrillation | Resuscitation | Cardiac arrest", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine | Emergency Medicine | Emergency", "output_id": 245644793, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85041494242", "journal_title": "Resuscitation", "journal_issn_list": "0300-9572", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 6, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 7, "internal_author_list": "Tierney, Nicholas John", "external_author_list": "Auricchio, Angelo | Benvenuti, Claudio | Burkart, Roman | Mira, Antonietta | Reinhold, H.

The first occurs in the early 60s and indicates a very large increase in the rate of growth of both temperature and radiative forcing series. This was termed as the \u201conset of sustained global warming\u201d. The second is related to the more recent so-called hiatus period, which suggests that temperatures and total radiative forcing have increased less rapidly since the mid-90s compared to the larger rate of increase from 1960 to 1990. There are two issues that remain unresolved. The first is whether the breaks in the slope of the trend functions of temperatures and radiative forcing are common. This is important because common breaks coupled with the basic science of climate change would strongly suggest a causal effect from anthropogenic factors to temperatures. The second issue relates to establishing formally via a proper testing procedure that takes into account the noise in the series, whether there was indeed a \u2018hiatus period\u2019 for temperatures since the mid 90s. This is important because such a test would counter the widely held view that the hiatus is the product of natural internal variability. Our paper provides tests related to both issues. The results show that the breaks in temperatures and radiative forcing are common and that the hiatus is characterized by a significant decrease in their rate of growth.

Finally, a comparative study with the corresponding literature is performed, which shows that the revised algorithm can not only improve the solution accuracy but also shorten the runtime greatly.</p>", "output_year": 2019, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Solving the green-fuzzy vehicle routing problem using a revised hybrid intelligent algorithm", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Wang, R, Zhou, J, Yi, X & Pantelous, AA 2019, 'Solving the green-fuzzy vehicle routing problem using a revised hybrid intelligent algorithm', Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing, vol. 10, no. 1, pp. 321-332. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12652-018-0703-9", "output_keywords": "Fuzzy simulation | Genetic algorithm | Fuzzy travel time | Green logistics | Vehicle routing problem", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "Computer Science(all)", "output_id": 240065689, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85049577211", "journal_title": "Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing", "journal_issn_list": "1868-5137", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 3, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 4, "internal_author_list": "Pantelous, Athanasios", "external_author_list": "Wang, Ruonan | Yi, Xiajie | Zhou, Jian", "external_author_org_list": "Shanghai University | Universiteit Gent (Ghent University)", "external_author_country_list": null, "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": -30.355207443237305, "y": -5.421012878417969}, {"output_uuid": "0bc0030d-f4bf-4004-a93f-00b214df6f87", "Abstract": "<p>In this study, we assess the dynamic evolution of short-term correlation, long-term cointegration and Error Correction Model (hereafter referred to as ECM)-based long-term Granger causality between each pair of US, UK, and Eurozone stock markets from 1980 to 2015 using the rolling-window technique. A comparative analysis of pairwise dynamic integration and causality of stock markets, measured in common and domestic currency terms, is conducted to evaluate comprehensively how exchange rate fluctuations affect the time-varying integration among the S&P 500, FTSE 100 and EURO STOXX 50 indices. The results obtained show that the dynamic correlation, cointegration and ECM-based long-run Granger causality vary significantly over the whole sample period. The degree of dynamic correlation and cointegration between pairs of stock markets rises in periods of high volatility and uncertainty, especially under the influence of economic, financial and political shocks. Meanwhile, we observe the weaker and decreasing correlation and cointegration among the three developed stock markets during the recovery periods. Interestingly, the most persistent and significant cointegration among the three developed stock markets exists during the 2007\u201309 global financial crisis. Finally, the exchange rate fluctuations, also influence the dynamic integration and causality between all pairs of stock indices, with that influence increasing under the local currency terms.

We report on an analysis of Australian case data to estimate the impact of test\u2013trace\u2013isolate\u2013quarantine systems on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Methods: Our analysis uses a novel mathematical modelling framework and detailed surveillance data on COVID-19 cases including dates of infection and dates of isolation. First, we directly translate an empirical distribution of times from infection to isolation into reductions in potential for onward transmission during periods of relatively low caseloads (tens to hundreds of reported cases per day). We then apply a simulation approach, validated against case data, to assess the impact of case-initiated contact tracing on transmission during a period of relatively higher caseloads and system stress (up to thousands of cases per day). Results: We estimate that under relatively low caseloads in the state of New South Wales (tens of cases per day), TTIQ contributed to a 54% reduction in transmission. Under higher caseloads in the state of Victoria (hundreds of cases per day), TTIQ contributed to a 42% reduction in transmission. Our results also suggest that case-initiated contact tracing can support timely quarantine in times of system stress (thousands of cases per day). Conclusion: Contact tracing systems for COVID-19 in Australia were highly effective and adaptable in supporting the national suppression strategy from 2020\u201321, prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant in November 2021.

Here, we explore how different combinations of hybrid immunity affect the size and severity of near-future Omicron waves.

Results: We find that if the past infection immunity is high but vaccination levels are low, then the secondary outbreak with the same variant can occur within a few months after the first outbreak; meanwhile, high vaccination levels can suppress near-term outbreaks and delay the second wave. Additionally, hybrid immunity has limited impact on future COVID-19 waves with immune-escape variants.

Mothers play a primary role in providing emotional and physical nourishment during early childhood. This systematic review aims to explore the association between maternal health and child health in the first five years of the child's life. Materials and methods As primary aims, we systematically synthesised published evidence relating to the first five years of life for associations between maternal health exposures (mental, physical and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and child health outcomes (physical health, mental health, HRQoL and Health Service Use (HSU) /cost). As a secondary aim, we explored how the above associations vary between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged populations. The search was limited to studies that published and collected data from 2010 to 2022. The systematic review was specific to countries with similar health systems to Australia. The search was conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, APA PsycINFO, GLOBAL HEALTH, and EMBASE databases. The quality of the included studies was assessed by The Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) tool. Results Thirteen articles were included in the final synthesis from the identified 9439 articles in the primary search. Six (46%) explored the association between maternal mental health and child's physical health, two (15%) explored maternal and child's physical health, one (8%) explored maternal and child's mental health, one (8%) explored maternal physical health and child's HRQoL, and three (23%) explored maternal mental health and child's HSU. We found an association between maternal health and child health (physical and mental) and HSU outcomes but no association between maternal health and child's overall HRQoL. The results for disadvantaged communities did not show any difference from the general population. Discussion and conclusion Our review findings show that maternal health influences the child's health in the first five years. However, the current evidence is limited, and the findings were primarily related to a specific maternal or child's health condition. There was no evidence of associations of child health outcomes in healthy mothers. There is an extensive research gap investigating maternal health exposures and child outcomes in quality of life and overall health.</p>", "output_year": 2024, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Review Article", "output_title": "The impact of maternal health on child's health outcomes during the first five years of child's life in countries with health systems similar to Australia", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Mudiyanselage, SB, Dona, SWA, Angeles, MR, Majmudar, I, Marembo, M, Tan, EJ, Price, A, Watts, JJ, Gold, L, Abimanyi-Ochom, J, 2024, 'The impact of maternal health on child's health outcomes during the first five years of child's life in countries with health systems similar to Australia', PLoS ONE, 19(3), e0295295. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0295295", "output_keywords": "", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "", "output_id": 580592062, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85187490145", "journal_title": "PLoS ONE", "journal_issn_list": "1932-6203", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 9, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 10, "internal_author_list": "Tan, Eng Joo", "external_author_list": "Mudiyanselage, Shalika Bohingamu | Dona, Sithara Wanni Arachchige | Angeles, Mary Rose | Majmudar, Ishani | Marembo, Miriam | Price, Anna | Watts, Jennifer J. | Gold, Lisa | Abimanyi-Ochom, Julie", "external_author_org_list": "Deakin University | Deakin University | Deakin University | Deakin University | Department of Education (Victoria) | Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne | Murdoch Children's Research Institute | University of Melbourne | Deakin University | Deakin University | Deakin University", "external_author_country_list": "", "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": 8.700175285339355, "y": -24.445297241210938}, {"output_uuid": "a6321717-3c19-4ff2-9437-59d4cdb1b537", "Abstract": "<p>Recently, there is a new stream of mortality forecasting research using the vector autoregressive model with different sparse model specifications.

Each centre in the family generates a testing problem, and the resulting family of hypotheses constitutes a familial hypothesis. A Bayesian nonparametric procedure is devised to test familial hypotheses, enabled by a novel pathwise optimization routine to fit the Huber family. The favourable properties of the new test are demonstrated theoretically and experimentally. Two examples from psychology serve as real-world case studies.</p>", "output_year": 2024, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Familial inference", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Thompson, R, Forbes, CS, Maceachern, SN, Peruggia, M, 2024, 'Familial inference', Biometrika, 111(3), 1029-1045. https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/asad074", "output_keywords": "Bayesian bootstrap | Dirichlet process | Huber loss | Hypothesis testing | Pathwise optimization", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "", "output_id": 600519126, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85203392891", "journal_title": "Biometrika", "journal_issn_list": "0006-3444", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 3, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 4, "internal_author_list": "Forbes, Catherine S.", "external_author_list": "Thompson, Ryan | Maceachern, Steven N. | Peruggia, Mario", "external_author_org_list": "Ohio State University | Ohio State University", "external_author_country_list": "", "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": -2.011651039123535, "y": -0.49135658144950867}, {"output_uuid": "42785e96-3383-4f5d-8152-0119529632db", "Abstract": "<p>Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) has gained popularity as a method for conducting inference and forecasting in complex models, most notably those which are intractable in some sense.

We sought to describe the hospital admission patterns of patients known to be colonised with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE), and compare them with CPE-negative patient cohorts, matched on comorbidity information. Methods: We performed a linkage study in Victoria, Australia, including datasets with notifiable diseases (CPE notifications) and hospital admissions (admission dates and diagnostic codes) for the period 2011 to 2020. Where the CPE notification date occurred during a hospital admission for the same patient, we identified this as the \u2018index admission\u2019. We determined the number of distinct health services each patient was admitted to, and time to first admission to a different health service. We compared CPE-positive patients with four cohorts of CPE-negative patients, sampled based on different matching criteria. Results: Of 528 unique patients who had CPE detected during a hospital admission, 222 (42%) were subsequently admitted to a different health service during the study period. Among these patients, CPE diagnosis tended to occur during admission to a metropolitan public hospital (86%, 190/222), whereas there was a greater number of metropolitan private (23%, 52/222) and rural public (18%, 39/222) hospitals for the subsequent admission. Median time to next admission was 4 days (IQR, 0\u201375 days). Admission patterns for CPE-positive patients was similar to the cohort of CPE-negative patients matched on index admission, time period, and age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index. Conclusions: Movement of CPE-positive patients between health services is not a rare event. While the most common movement is from one public metropolitan health service to another, there is also a trend for movement from metropolitan public hospitals into private and rural hospitals. After accounting for clinical comorbidities, CPE colonisation status does not appear to impact on hospital admission frequency or timing.

The relationship between the insurer and reinsurers is described by a Stackelberg model, where reinsurers, as market leaders, set prices for reinsurance treaties, and the insurer, as a price taker, determines reinsurance demand. Furthermore, we employ a Nash game to model the price competition between the two reinsurers who adopt different premium principles: the variance premium principle and the expected value premium principle. Both the insurer and reinsurers aim to maximize their respective mean-variance cost functions, leading to a time inconsistency control problem. This issue is resolved using a corresponding extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in the game-theoretic framework.

Thus, the proposed method is an improvement over the standard method based on the fixed effects model, which is widely used in the literature for modelling crop yield. We apply the proposed approach to model wheat yields across 24 statistical areas that cover the wheat belt of the state of Victoria, Australia. Our forecasts point to a potential 14% loss in yields in the state of Victoria and a 27% loss in North-West Victoria, under the Hotter &amp; Drier climate scenario, which the IPCC predicts to be more likely for Victoria in the medium term.

Random forests have been shown to be a flexible and powerful approach to HTE estimation in both randomized trials and observational studies. In particular \u201ccausal forests\u201d introduced by Athey, Tibshirani and Wager (Ann. Statist. 47 (2019) 1148\u20131178), along with the R implementation in package grf were rapidly adopted. A related approach, called \u201cmodel-based forests\u201d that is geared toward randomized trials and simultaneously captures effects of both prognostic and predictive variables, was introduced by Seibold, Zeileis and Hothorn (Stat. Methods Med. Res. 27 (2018) 3104\u20133125) along with a modular implementation in the R package model4you. Neither procedure is directly applicable to the estimation of individualized predictions of excess postpartum blood loss caused by a cesarean section in comparison to vaginal delivery. Clearly, randomization is hardly possible in this setup, and thus model-based forests lack clinical trial data to address this question. On the other hand, the skewed and interval-censored postpartum blood loss observations violate assumptions made by causal forests. Here we present a tailored model-based forest for skewed and interval-censored data to infer possible predictive prepartum characteristics and their impact on excess postpartum blood loss caused by a cesarean section. As a methodological basis, we propose a unifying view on causal and model-based forests that goes beyond the theoretical motivations and investigates which computational elements make causal forests so successful and how these can be blended with the strengths of model-based forests. To do so, we show that both methods can be understood in terms of the same parameters and model assumptions for an additive model under L<sub>2</sub> loss. This theoretical insight allows us to implement several flavors of \u201cmodel-based causal forests\u201d and dissect their different elements in silico. The original causal forests and model-based forests are compared with the new blended versions in a benchmark study exploring both randomized trials and observational settings. In the randomized setting, both approaches performed akin. If confounding was present in the data-generating process, we found local centering of the treatment indicator with the corresponding propensities to be the main driver for good performance. Local centering of the outcome was less important and might be replaced or enhanced by simultaneous split selection with respect to both prognostic and predictive effects.

This method introduces bias due to differential rater knowledge of disorders and inability to disentangle the disability due to disorders from the disability due to comorbidities. Methods: We propose an alternative, data-driven, method of generating disorder-specific disability scores that assesses disorders in a sample of individuals either from population medical registry data or population survey self-reports and uses Generalized Random Forests (GRF) to predict global (rather than disorder-specific) disability assessed by clinician ratings or by survey respondent self-reports. This method also provides a principled basis for studying patterns and predictors of heterogeneity in disorder-specific disability. We illustrate this method by analyzing data for 16 disorders assessed in the World Mental Health Surveys (n\u00a0=\u00a053,645). Results: Adjustments for comorbidity decreased estimates of disorder-specific disability substantially.

It is a hybrid method, where at each step the global parameters are updated using the natural gradient and the latent variables are generated from their conditional posterior. A fast to compute expression for the Tikhonov damped Fisher information matrix is used, along with the re-parameterization trick, to provide a stable natural gradient. We apply the approach to deep mixed models, which are an emerging class of Bayesian neural networks with random output layer coefficients to allow for heterogeneity. A range of simulations show that using the natural gradient is substantially more efficient than using the ordinary gradient, and that the approach is faster and more accurate than two cutting-edge natural gradient VI methods.

In practical applications, some series in a structure often produce poor base forecasts due to model misspecification or low forecastability.

However, the effect of hospitalization in reducing subsequent suicidal behaviors is poorly understood and likely heterogeneous. OBJECTIVES To estimate the association of psychiatric hospitalization with subsequent suicidal behaviors using observational data and develop a preliminary predictive analytics individualized treatment rule accounting for heterogeneity in this association across patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A machine learning analysis of retrospective data was conducted. All veterans presenting with suicidal ideation (SI) or suicide attempt (SA) from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2015, were included. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2022, to March 10, 2023. Subgroups were defined by primary psychiatric diagnosis (nonaffective psychosis, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and other) and suicidality (SI only, SA in past 2-7 days, and SA in past day). Models were trained in 70.0% of the training samples and tested in the remaining 30.0%. EXPOSURES Psychiatric hospitalization vs nonhospitalization. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Fatal and nonfatal SAs within 12 months of ED/UC visits were identified in administrative records and the National Death Index. Baseline covariates were drawn from electronic health records and geospatial databases. RESULTS Of 196 610 visits (90.3% men; median [IQR] age, 53 [41-59] years), 71.5% resulted in hospitalization. The 12-month SA risk was 11.9% with hospitalization and 12.0% with nonhospitalization (difference, \u22120.1%; 95% CI, \u22120.4% to 0.2%). In patients with SI only or SA in the past 2 to 7 days, most hospitalization was not associated with subsequent SAs. For patients with SA in the past day, hospitalization was associated with risk reductions ranging from \u22126.9% to \u22129.6% across diagnoses. Accounting for heterogeneity, hospitalization was associated with reduced risk of subsequent SAs in 28.1% of the patients and increased risk in 24.0%. An individualized treatment rule based on these associations may reduce SAs by 16.0% and hospitalizations by 13.0% compared with current rates. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings of this study suggest that psychiatric hospitalization is associated with reduced average SA risk in the immediate aftermath of an SA but not after other recent SAs or SI only. Substantial heterogeneity exists in these associations across patients. An individualized treatment rule accounting for this heterogeneity could both reduce SAs and avert hospitalizations.</p>", "output_year": 2024, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Estimated average treatment effect of psychiatric hospitalization in patients with suicidal behaviors", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Ross, EL, Bossarte, RM, Dobscha, SK, Gildea, SM, Hwang, I, Kennedy, CJ, Liu, H, Luedtke, A, Marx, BP, Nock, MK et al., 2024, 'Estimated average treatment effect of psychiatric hospitalization in patients with suicidal behaviors', JAMA Psychiatry, 81(2), 135-143. https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2023.3994", "output_keywords": "", "asjc_scopus_subject_areas": "", "output_id": 620606698, "publication_import_source": "Scopus", "publication_import_id": "85181023767", "journal_title": "JAMA Psychiatry", "journal_issn_list": "2168-622X", "output_indicator_validated": "Validated", "output_author_count_external": 15, "output_author_count_internal": 1, "output_author_count_total": 16, "internal_author_list": "Sverdrup, Erik", "external_author_list": "Ross, Eric L. | Bossarte, Robert M. | Dobscha, Steven K. | Gildea, Sarah M. | Hwang, Irving | Kennedy, Chris J. | Liu, Howard | Luedtke, Alex | Marx, Brian P. | Nock, Matthew K. | Petukhova, Maria V. | Sampson, Nancy A. | Zainal, Nur Hani | Wager, Stefan | Kessler, Ronald C.", "external_author_org_list": "University of Vermont | University of South Florida | VA Portland Health Care System (Portland VA Medical Center) | Malcom Randall Veterans Affairs Medical Center | Harvard Medical School | Massachusetts General Hospital | Harvard Medical School | Malcom Randall Veterans Affairs Medical Center | University of Washington | Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center | VA Boston Health Care System | Boston University | Massachusetts General Hospital | Harvard University | Harvard Medical School | Harvard Medical School | Harvard Medical School | Stanford University | Stanford University | Harvard Medical School", "external_author_country_list": "", "administering_org_unit": "Econometrics & Business Statistics", "administering_faculty_unit": "Faculty of Business & Economics", "topic": -1, "x": -30.75974464416504, "y": -1.2773537635803223}, {"output_uuid": "316dcbe2-ed30-4880-a51a-eedee2403892", "Abstract": "<p>The increasing frequency of severe wildfires demands a shift in landscape management to mitigate their consequences.

In modern big data analyses, useful broad structural judgements may be elicited from the decision-maker but a level of interpolation is required to arrive at a likelihood model. As a result, an often computationally convenient canonical form is used in place of the decision-maker\u2019s true beliefs. Equally, in practice, observational datasets often contain unforeseen heterogeneities and recording errors and therefore do not necessarily correspond to how the data generating process was idealised by the decision-maker. Acknowledging such imprecisions, a faithful Bayesian analysis should ideally be stable across reasonable equivalence classes of such inputs. We are able to guarantee that traditional Bayesian updating provides stability across only a very strict class of likelihood models and data generating processes, requiring the decision-maker to elicit their beliefs and understand how the data was generated with an unreasonable degree of accuracy. On the other hand, a generalised Bayesian alternative using the \u03b2-divergence loss function is shown to be stable across practical and interpretable neighbourhoods, providing assurances that posterior inferences are not overly dependent on accidentally introduced spurious specifications or data collection errors. We illustrate this in linear regression, binary classification, and mixture modelling examples, showing that stable updating does not compromise the ability to learn about the data generating process.

As part of a pilot intervention project, academics from two leading Universities organised data literacy boot camps for high school students across various cities in Indonesia.

This paper explores student participants\u2019 self-perception of their data literacy as a result of the skills acquired from the boot camps. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected through student surveys and a focus group discussion, and were used to analyse student perception post-intervention. The findings indicate that students became more aware of the usefulness of data literacy and its application in future studies and work after participating in the boot camp. Of the materials delivered at the boot camps, students found the greatest benefit in learning basic statistical concepts and applying them through the use of Microsoft Excel as a tool for basic data analysis.

We present a general statistical model for predicting the strength of protection conferred by different immunising exposures (numbers, types, and strains of both vaccines and infections), against multiple outcomes of interest, whilst accounting for immune waning. We predict immune protection against key clinical outcomes: developing symptoms, hospitalisation, and death. We also predict transmission-related outcomes: acquisition of infection and onward transmission in breakthrough infections. These enable quantification of the impact of immunity on population-level transmission dynamics. Our model calibrates the level of immune protection, drawing on both population-level data, such as vaccine effectiveness estimates, and neutralising antibody levels as a correlate of protection. This enables the model to learn realised immunity levels beyond those which can be predicted by antibody kinetics or other correlates alone. We demonstrate an application of the model for SARS-CoV-2, and predict the individual-level protective effectiveness conferred by natural infections with the Delta and the Omicron B.1.1.529 variants, and by the BioNTech-Pfizer (BNT162b2), Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1), and 3rd-dose mRNA booster vaccines, against outcomes for both Delta and Omicron. We also demonstrate a use case of the model in late 2021 during the emergence of Omicron, showing how the model can be rapidly updated with emerging epidemiological data on multiple variants in the same population, to infer key immunogenicity and intrinsic transmissibility characteristics of the new variant, before the former can be more directly observed via vaccine effectiveness data. This model provided timely inference on rapidly evolving epidemic situations of significant concern during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The operation of leagues for Australian Rules football in Victoria provides a unique setting, where the subelite competition, the Victorian Football Association (VFA) which was the pre-1897 incumbent league operated as a competitor without a promotion/relegation setting of a divisional league or a feeder team minor leagues structure with the elite Victorian Football League (renamed the Australian Football League from 1990) which was the post-1897 rival league.</p>", "output_year": 2024, "output_indicator_research": "Research", "output_type": "Contribution to journal", "output_subtype": "Article", "output_title": "Competitive balance in the Victorian Football Association (VFA), 1897\u20131999", "output_bibliographic_text_harvard": "Brooks, R, Booth, R, 2024, 'Competitive balance in the Victorian Football Association (VFA), 1897\u20131999', Sporting Traditions, 41(1), 21-34.
